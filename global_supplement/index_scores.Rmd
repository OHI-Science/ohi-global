The overall index score for each region ($I_{region}$) is calculated as a weighted average of all the scores ($G$), for each goal ($g$) such that:

$$
{ I_{region} }\quad =\quad \frac { \sum _{ g=1 }^{ N }{ { w }_{ g }{ G }_{ g } }  }{ \sum _{ g=1 }^{ N }{ { w }_{ g } }  }, (Eq. 4.1) 
$$


where, $w_{g}$ is the weight for each goal.

For the global assessment, the goal weights ($w_{g}$) were assumed to be equal, even though we know this assumption does not hold for most individuals or across individuals within communities.  Ideally these weights would be derived empirically, but such an effort would require surveying a full spectrum of people from every single country. This was beyond the scope of this project, but may be possible in a future application of the Index.

In many places certain goals are not relevant, for example, production-focused goals typically do not apply to uninhabited islands, and the coastal protection or carbon storage goals will not apply to regions without the relevant coastal ecosystems. 

The overall global index score ($I_{global}$) is calculated as the area weighted average of the index scores ($I_{region}$) for each region ($i$): 

$$
{ I }_{ global }\quad =\quad \frac { \sum _{ i=1 }^{ N }{ { a }_{ i }{ I }_{ region,i } }  }{ \sum _{ i=1 }^{ N }{ { a }_{ i } }  }, (Eq. 4.2) 
$$

where, $a_{i}$ is each region's ocean area, based on the EEZ area.
