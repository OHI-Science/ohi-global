# Calculating trends

The Trend is calculated as the proportion change in Status based on recent data. In most cases, trend is calculated by: 1. estimating the yearly change in status using a linear regression model of status data from the most recent five years of data
2. dividing the slope by the status value of the first year of data (to estimate proportional change), and 
3. then mulitiplying by five to estimate the change in status five years into the future.

Because status values range from 0-1, Trends will typically range from -1.0 to 1.0; and we constrained values to this range if they fell outside it.

For all goals we
included non-significant trends as their non-zero
slopes. We chose to include these values for two
key reasons: 1) We were not trying to predict the
future but instead only indicate likely condition. 2)
In nearly all cases we did not have sufficient data
to conduct more rigorous trend analyses.

We multiply the slope estimate by five because our goal is to look beyond
just a single year into the future when assessing
likely future condition (i.e. sustainability), but we
know that many things affect Trends in the nearterm
future that will modify them from being a
simple linear trend (as we presume here),
including altered pressures and resilience
responses, nonlinear patterns in system response,
stochastic environmental and biological
variability, and simple bounding conditions (Status
cannot go below zero or above 1.0, and so the
Trend must level off as it approaches these
values).

In some cases, it isn't possible, due to data limitations, to estimate trend from status data.  In these cases, we used alternative methods to estimate trend.  For example, for the Species condition goal, we converted IUCN trend information (e.g., "increasing", "decreasing", etc.) to numeric values and then averaged these for each region. In the sections that describe calculating current status for each goal we also include specific information about trend calculations.

It is important to note that the Trend does not
distinguish between different causes of the same
potential Trend. For example, declines due to
unsustainable harvest of a resource can look
identical to declines due to restrictions placed on resource users to allow the resource to recover. It
also may be too short a time frame to determine
true trends or the causes of those trends, but the
intent here is more about informing the likely
near-term trajectory.
