See **`r layer_meta$name[layer_meta$layer == 'mar_sustainability_score']`** for more information about these data.

Two mariculture practice criteria from the Marine Sustainability Index (Trujillo 2008) contributed to the resilience of mariculture (traceability and code of practice). These are the only 2 social criteria assessed in the MSI that have the potential to positively affect the long term resilience of a mariculture system. 

The MSI reports data for 359 country-species combinations (with 60 countries and 86 species represented) for each assessment criterion. Scores for each assessment criterion were aggregated and averaged. All country average scores were then rescaled from 0 to 1 using the maximum possible raw MSI score of 10 and minimum of 1, and then weighted equally to come up with a composite resilience. 

Unlike the mariculture sustainability data (**`r layer_meta$name[layer_meta$layer == 'mar_sustainability_score']`**), gapfilling was not performed when country specific data were not available for the two resilience measures because these measures are social in nature and reliant on the specific decisions made by each country rather than on the species cultured. As such, it was decided that crosscountry species averages were not appropriate to use in the gapfilling process for resilience.

**Table 6.7. Mariculture Sustainability Index criteria**

Criteria         | Description of practice and score scheme
----------------- | ----------------------------------------
Code of practice usage | Certification, up to date set of standards and principles, i.e., FAO Code of Conduct (FAO 1995, 1999), or Eco-labelling are scored high, while no certification or similar scheme scores low (1)
Traceability    | Food safety related to a specific geographical origin, slaughtering or processing facility, and batch of fish can be identified scores high (8-9). If the original and preparation of feed used in the farmed sector is included then scores high (10).
