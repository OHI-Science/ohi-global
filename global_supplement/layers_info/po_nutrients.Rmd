Data were calculated using modeled plumes of land-based nitrogen pollution that provide intensity of pollution at ~1km resolution (Halpern et al. 2008). 

Nitrogen pollution was estimated from FAO data on annual country-level fertilizer use ([http://faostat3.fao.org/faostat-gateway/go/to/browse/R/*/E](http://faostat3.fao.org/faostat-gateway/go/to/browse/R/*/E)), with missing values estimated by regression between fertilizer and pesticides when possible, and when not possible with agricultural GDP as a proxy.  Data were summed across all fertilizer compounds and reported in metric tons. Upon inspection the data included multiple 0 values that are most likely data gaps in the time-series, so they were treated as such and replaced with NA. In addition, regions with only 1 data point and regions where the most recent data point was prior to 2005 were excluded. Uninhabited countries were assumed to have no fertilizer use and thus excluded. 

These country-level pollution values were then dasymetrically distributed over a country’s landscape using global landcover data from 2009, derived from the MODIS satellite at ~500m resolution. These values were then aggregated by ~140,000 global basins, and diffusive plumes were modeled from each basin’s pourpoint. The final non-zero plumes (about ~76,000) were aggregated into ~1km Mollweide (wgs84) projection rasters to produce a single plume-aggregated pollution raster. 

These raw values were then $ln(X+1)$ transformed and normalized to 0-1 by dividing by the 99.99th quantile of raster values across all years.  The zonal mean was then calculated for each region.
