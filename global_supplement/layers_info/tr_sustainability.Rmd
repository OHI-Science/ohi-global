The Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index is produced by the World Economic Forum and measures the factors and policies that make a country an attractive place to invest in the travel and tourism sector (WEF 2015, [http://reports.weforum.org/travel-and-tourism-competitiveness-report-2015](http://reports.weforum.org/travel-and-tourism-competitiveness-report-2015)). The index analyzes 140 countries and scores each based on three sub-indices: human, cultural, and natural resources; business environment and infrastructure; and regulatory framework. These three sub-indices are in turn composed of 14 “pillars” of Travel & Tourism Competitiveness that are informed by a multitude of individual indicators based on the World Economic Forum’s annual Executive Opinion Survey and data from publically available sources: human, cultural, and natural resources (human resources, affinity for travel and tourism, natural resources, and cultural resources); business environment and infrastructure (air transport infrastructure, ground transport infrastructure, tourism infrastructure, ICT infrastructure, and price competitiveness in the industry); and regulatory framework (policy rules and regulations, environmental sustainability, safety and security, health and hygiene, and prioritization of travel and tourism). Because these indicators are meant to represent the overall quality and future potential of the tourism sector within a country, we assume they are representative of the long term sustainability of the tourism sector within each country.  Values range from 1-6. 

For countries not assessed, values were estimated using a linear regression model specific to each UN geopolitical region using per-capita GDP as a predictor variable.
