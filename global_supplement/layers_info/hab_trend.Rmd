#### Coral 
Coral trend was calculated using condition data from 1975-2006 (Bruno and Selig 2007, Schutte et al. 2010).

#### Mangroves 
We used Hamilton and Casey's (2014) mangrove cover data to estimate the proportional yearly change in mangrove area using a linear regression model of the most recent five years of data (i.e., slope divided by data from the earliest year included in the regression model).  The slope was then multiplied by five to get the predicted change in 5 years.  The original mangrove data are provided yearly (2000-2012) at 30m raster cell resolution (with the estimated area of mangrove cover in each cell). 

#### Salt marsh 
General trends in salt marsh area were determined from 1994-2007 using data from multiple sources (Bridgham et al. 2006, Dahl 2000, Ministry for the Environment 2007, JNCC 2004, EEA 2008). For trend estimates, we extracted categorical condition data (‘increasing”, “stable”, “declining” score as 0.5, 0.0, and -0.5, respectively) from these sources on a per country basis when both a current and reference data year were available.

#### Sea-ice 
Trends for sea-ice edge and sea-ice shoreline habitats were calculated using sea-ice concentrations from the USA National Snow and Ice Data Center (Cavalieri et al. 2014; [https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/quickfacts/seaice.html](https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/quickfacts/seaice.html)).  The average yearly proportional change in extent was estimated using a linear regression model that included the most recent five years of data (e.g., slope estimate was divided by the extent for earliest year included in the regression model), and this value was multiplied by five to get the predicted change in 5 years.  Each year of data represents a 3-year average, to smooth yearly variation.    

#### Seagrass 
Trend in seagrass condition was determined using two data sources (Waycott et al. 2009, Short et al. 2010). Short et al. (2010) measured percent cover on a per sample, per site, per year basis, whereas Waycott et al. (2009) measured habitat area on a per site, per year basis. We used data from Short if there were at least 3 data points between 2001-2010. If this condition was not met, we calculated trends from Waycott for the most recent 10 years after 1990 or else we used the mean of the trend in the adjacent regions or the regions within the corresponding seagrass geographical regions using the same methods described above for the in status.

#### Soft bottom subtidal 
Trend in soft bottom subtidal condition was estimated using a linear regression model that included the most recent five years of condition data. The proportional change in condition was determined (e.g., slope estimate was divided by the condition value for earliest year included in the regression) and then multiplied by five to get the change predicted in 5 years.
