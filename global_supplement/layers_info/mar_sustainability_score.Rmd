Three mariculture practice criteria from the Marine Sustainability Index (Trujillo 2008) contributed to the sustainability of mariculture (fishmeal use, waste treatment, and seed and larvae origin criteria). These criteria represent the internal mariculture practices with the potential to affect the long term sustainability of the mariculture system. The MSI reports data for 359 country-species combinations (with 60 countries and 86 species represented) for each assessment criterion. Scores for each assessment criterion were aggregated and averaged based on the proportion of the landings that each assessed species contributed to the overall catch in each country in the current year. All country average scores were then rescaled from 0 to 1 using the maximum possible raw MSI score of 10 and minimum of 1, and then weighted equally to calculate a composite resilience. Because the Index comprises species-specific sustainability values that are combined as a catch-weighted average, when the list of species harvested changes, the sustainability index used in the mariculture sub-goal model also changes due to shifts in the relative composition of harvested species.

Species/country combinations that were not assessed by the MSI were gapfilled using average data from similar taxonomic groupings from other countries (ideally we used the same species, but used more general taxonomic groupings when necessary).

Criteria         | Description of practice and score scheme
----------------- | ----------------------------------------
Fishmeal use      | Fish protein and oil inclusion in the diet at any stage of development must be considered; herbivore species will score 10, and carnivorous (piscivorous) organisms will score closer to 1, depending on the level of feed supplied.
Waste treatment    | Water exchange, output destinations, recycling and filtering of open water discharge or closed system reuse systems. Systems that are closed score high (10), while open systems without waste treatments score low (1)
Seed and larvae origin   | Hatcheries are major providers of larvae, fry and seeds. Broodstock origin and strain will also affect the score. Wild seed collection and its importance contribute to a low score due to bycatch and other effects on non-target species.
