National GDP data were obtained from the World Bank [http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ NY.GDP.MKTP.CD](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ NY.GDP.MKTP.CD) and converted into 2012 USD from current USD.  These data were used in economy subgoal to adjust revenue data. For the three EEZs that fall within the China region (China, Macau, and Hong Kong), we combined the values using a population-weighted average.
