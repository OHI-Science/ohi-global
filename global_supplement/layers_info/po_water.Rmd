*Resilience*

*Category: ecological/regulatory*

*Subcategory: water*

The country responses to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Third National Report (2005). Each
question was weighted equally within each category and responses were averaged to give a score between 0 and 1 for all responding countries. The survey uses a 0 to 3 scale for questions 79 and 81, and a 0 to 2 scale for question 80, which we rescale linearly to 0 to 1.

All countries were given credit within each of the 4 resilience measures for simply being a member of the CBD (0.5), the other 0.5 of the resilience score came from each country’s response to the specific questions within each resilience measure. In cases where the "European Union" answered yes or was a signatory, all EU25 countries were given that answer if they did not provide one themselves. 

The CBD has 193 members and 153 members responded to the Third National Survey (2005). We had data for 147
regions, and used geographical means, weighted by country area, for the remaining regions.
