This data layer provides the risk category and the year the species was assessed from the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species ([http://www.iucnredlist.org/](http://www.iucnredlist.org/)) for the iconic species in each region.   Regionally specific IUCN risk category data for *subpopulations* are included where available. Trend calculations are based on the change in each species' IUCN risk category over time, based upon past and current IUCN assessments.

OHI defines iconic species as those relevant to local cultural identity through the species’ relationship to traditional activities such as fishing, hunting, commerce or involvement in local ethnic or religious practices;  and species with locally-recognized aesthetic value (e.g., touristic attractions/common artistic subjects such as whales).  Habitat forming species are excluded in this definition of iconic species. The OHI global iconic species list combines three species lists from WWF Global: global priorities, regional and local priorities, and flagship species.  The criteria for including species on the WWF lists are consistent with the OHI’s definition of iconic species.  

Once the species lists were obtained, each species was assigned to a region based on native range countries from the IUCN Red List. 

Most of the iconic species are not region specific, and the global list is applied across all regions.   However, some countries have developed national priority and flagship species lists in conjunction with WWF.   These region-specific iconic species lists supplement the global list for those specific countries only. In addition, as countries and regions conduct OHI regional assessments ([http://ohi-science.org/projects/](http://ohi-science.org/projects/)), we will use the iconic species list developed by those countries/regions to supplement our global model.  For example, iconic species identified for the Baltic Health Index regional assessment have been included for all countries bordering the Baltic Sea.
