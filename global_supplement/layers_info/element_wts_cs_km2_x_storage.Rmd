This layer describes the relative value of the habitats in each region to carbon storage, and is calculated by multiplying the habitat extent (km^2^) in each region by the amount of carbon the habitat sequesters (Laffoley & Grimsditch 2009). These data are called internally by ohicore functions (see: conf/config.R to see how these data are specified) to weight the data used to calculate pressure and resilience values. 

**Table 6.3. Carbon storage weights**

Habitat | Carbon storage
------------- | -------------
Mangrove | 139
Saltmarsh | 210 
Seagrass | 83
