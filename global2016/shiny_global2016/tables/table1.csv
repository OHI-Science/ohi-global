Artisanal opportunities,"<ul><li>Need: Additional years of data, and a slightly different version of the WorldBank dataset to control for inflation<li>Opportunity: None",Reference point for 'need' data is now the 95th quantile among regions (rather than max value).,The change in reference point increased scores.
Biodiversity: Species,<ul><li>Assessed species: Additional years of IUCN (species status and range) and Aquamaps (species range) data,Added bird species from BirdLife International.<p>Used a new threshold for determining presence/absence of species in Aquamaps data.  <p>In addition to informing our analysis this information will be useful to other researchers.  The conclusions have been published in PLoS (O'Hara et al.).,The addition of bird data generally increased scores because there are several bird species that are widespread and at low extinction risk.
Biodiversity: Habitats,<ul><li>Sea ice edge: Additional years of data (trend and condition updated)<li>Mangrove: None<li>Saltmarsh: None<li>Seagrass: None<li>Coral: None<li>Softbottom: New SAUP fisheries data (trend and condition updated)</ul>,None,"The National Snow & Ice Data Center updated their data, but this did not affect our scores in any significant way."
Food Provision: Fisheries,"<ul><li>Catch: Improved Sea Around Us data (now provided as rasters at a 0.5 degree grid level and in categories such as commercial, subsistence, etc.); unfortunately, no additional years of data (2010 most recent year). <li>B/B<sub>MSY</sub>: Now RAM B/B<sub>MSY</sub> data used when possible (these data are based on formal stock assessments); updated values with new catch data using the data-limited catch-MSY method","Simplified method of calculating B/B<sub>MSY</sub>.  Previously, model priors depended on the region's fisheries resilience score (based on data from Mora et al. 2009).  However, our analyses suggest this does not improve results.  <p>Modified the taxonomic penalty for catch not identified to species because these penalties were magnified due to the use of the geometric mean to estimate average stock condition.<p>We explored several models (including ensemble approaches) besides the catch-MSY to generate B/B<sub>MSY</sub> values, but preliminary analyses did not indicate these methods were better than the catch-MSY approach.","2016 scores were very different than 2015 scores.  This was due primarily to differences in the SAU catch data. One of the main differences is that, in some places, more catch is now identified as 'marine fishes not identified'.  When catch is not identified to the species level, it is penalized in the fisheries model because this is considered an indicator of poor management. This tended to decrease scores.<p>Other variables affecting scores:<ul><li>Changes to the taxonomic penalty in the model (increased scores)<li>Addition of RAM data for B/B<sub>MSY</sub> scores<li>Changes to catch-MSY calculations<li>Better resolution data"
Food Provision: Mariculture ,<ul><li>Production: Additional years of FAO data<li>Sustainability: None<li>Population: Updated methods (estimates calculated using higher resolution spatial data),None,Retroactive changes to FAO data resulted in some differences in scores
Coastal protection,<ul><li>Sea ice shoreline: Additional years of data (trend and condition updated)<li>Mangrove: None<li>Saltmarsh: None<li>Seagrass: None<li>Coral: None,None,"The National Snow & Ice Data Center updated their data, but this did not affect our scores in any significant way."
Carbon storage,<ul><li>Mangrove: None<li>Saltmarsh: None<li>Seagrass: None,None,None
Clean waters,"<ul><li>Nutrient pollution: Additional years of FAO fertilizer data (trend and pressure)<li>Chemical pollution: Shipping and ports: None<li>Chemical pollution: Land-based inorganic: None<li>Chemical pollution: Land-based organic: Additional years of FAO pesticide data<li>Pathogens: None<li>Trash: None for pressure data, but trend data was updated with a new dataset",Previously we used population as a proxy for the trash trend.  Now we use trends in plastic disposal.,"Replacing the trash trend data had a very small effect on scores.  On average clean water scores decreased slightly, but less than 5 points."
Sense of Place: Iconic species,<ul><li>Assessed species: Additional years of (species status and range) and Aquamaps (species range) data. Added additional region specific iconic species to master list.,Trend is now calculated using historical changes in IUCN risk category.  This is a huge improvement over the previous method which relied on the IUCN population trend data. ,Scores generally increased because the previous method overestimated trend effects.<p>More accurate scores in Baltic regions due to changes in iconic species list.
Sense of Place: Lasting special places ,<ul><li>Area: Additional years of WDPA data<li>Spatial data: Improved estimates of offshore/inland areas,None,"Retroactive changes to source data and changes to area altered scores slightly in most regions, although changes to WDPA data had a large effect on a handful of regions."
Natural products,<ul><li>Harvest: Two additional years of FAO data,Corrected how fishery scores are integrated  into score calculations (used as sustainability component of fish oil product).,"Previously, the 2015 assessment used 2011 data, now it uses 2012 data.<p>Retroactive changes to source data changed scores somewhat.<p>Countries that have sporadic harvests have high yearly variation in scores.<p>Changes to fishery scores alter scores"
Tourism and recreation,<ul><li>Tourism sustainability: None<br>Employment: New year of WEF data<br>Travel warnings: New year of data,Improved approach to dealing with travel warnings in the model.,Retroactive changes to source data changed scores and there were a few changes to the travel warning classifications.
