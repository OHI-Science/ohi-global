Pressure,Updates to data,Updates to data prep or model,NotesSocial: World Governance Index,Additional years of data.,Small improvement to gapfilling.,Small changes in a handful of countries.Social: Social Progress Index ,New pressure layer.,New pressure layer.,Tended to increase pressure scores because SPI scores tend to be higher than WGI scores (the other component of social resilience).Climate change: Ocean acidification,Additional years of data.,"Improved rescaling method: values greater than biological threshold of 1 are rescaled based on their absolute change in aragonite saturation state weighted by distance to 1 (closer to 1, higher pressure value).",Pressure scores tended to decrease very slightly.Climate change: UV,Additional years of data; limited data to only one dataset (previous calculations used a different dataset for the reference point).,Improved reference point; New reference point is the 99.99th quantile of the entire time series .,Very slight decrease in pressure score.Climate change: Sea level rise,Improved data (higher temporal resolution) along with more recent data.,"Clip pressure to near offshore areas (rather than including entire EEZ, which is not biologically relevant).<p>Improved reference point: 99.99th quantile across the entire timeseries.",Very small (<5 points) increase in pressure score.Climate change: Sea surface temperature,None,Improved reference point: 99.99th quantile across the entire timeseries.,Resulted in a slight increase in pressure scores (most regions < 2.5 points).Pollution: Land-based nutrient pollution,Additional years of FAO fertilizer data,None,Pollution: Chemical pollution,<ul><li>Organic land-based: additional years of FAO pesticide data. <li>Shipping ports: None <li>Inorganic land-based: None.,None,Pollution: Trash,None,None,Pollution: Pathogens,None,None,Species: Genetic escapes,Additional years of data.,None,Species: Targeted harvest,Additional years of data.,None,Retroactive changes to source data resulted in small changes to pressure score.Species: Invasive species,None,None,Commercial fisheries: high bycatch,Improved Sea Around US data (now provided at raster spatial scale and by sector); Net primary productivity used to standardize catch was updated.,Small change to reference point (99.99th quantile across the entire time series).<p>Artisanal catch removed (not possible previously because catch data was not categorized into types).,Relatively small (<10 points) increase in pressure score.Commercial fisheries: low bycatch,Improved Sea Around US data (now provided at raster spatial scale and by sector); Net primary productivity used to standardize catch was updated.,Small change to reference point (99.99th quantile across the entire time series).<p>Artisanal catch removed (not possible previously because catch data was not categorized into types).,Relatively small (<10 points) increase in pressure score.Artisanal fisheries: low bycatch,Improved Sea Around US data (now provided at raster spatial scale); Net primary productivity used to standardize catch was updated.,"Catch includes: artisanal, subsistence, and recreational catch (SAUP catch data now categorized).",Relatively small (<5 points) increase in pressure score.Artisanal fisheries: high bycatch ,None,"Values now include blast and poison data (previously only included blast data).<p>Values are now averaged over 3nm offshore area rather than the entire EEZ, which aligns better with where artisanal fishing occurs.",Tended to increase pressures in a few regions.Habitat destruction: soft-bottom subtidal,Improved Sea Around Us data (now provided at raster spatial scale).,None,No large changes in scores.Habitat destruction: Intertidal (nearshore population used as proxy),None,Improved estimate of population data using higher resolution spatial data <br> New approach to rescaling data.,Generally increased pressure scores (0-15 points).Habitat destruction: subtidal hard-bottom,None,None,
