#### Alignment comparison of paired maps

<font size = 2>
Overlaying paired distribution maps for each species, we defined and calculated _distribution alignment_, which compares how well the two maps agree based on the amount of the smaller range that overlaps the larger range; and _area ratio_, which compares the range size predicted by each map, based on the ratio of the smaller range to the larger range.  

Plotting the distribution alignment and area ratio for each of the 2,330 species in both datasets, we defined quadrants based on how well the maps aligned for each species.  

This plot corresponds to Fig 2A from the published paper and Fig S4A from the supporting information.
