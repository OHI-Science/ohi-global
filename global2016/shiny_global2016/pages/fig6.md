**Fig 6. Relationship between change in OHI score and rank.**
The change in each countryâ€™s OHI score and rank was calculated from 2012 to 2016. Black line is the linear regression slope estimate. A comparison of the Republique du Congo and Gilbert Islands (Kiribati) illustrates how roughly the same change in score (-7.52 vs. -7.89, respectively) can result in a very different change in rank (-12 vs. -78); note also cases where the same change in rank can result from very different changes in scores (not highlighted).  Blue points indicate regions that had a decrease in score but an increase in rank (N=12); and red points indicate an increase in score and decrease in rank (N=4).
