By constraining IUCN ranges for corals to depths less than 200 meters, we reduce the IUCN predicted range without affecting the AquaMaps predicted range.  In so doing, we remove a source of commission error caused by IUCN inclusion of an artificial 50 km coastal buffer into inappropriately deep areas; this typically improves the area ratio alignment without significantly reducing the distribution alignment.

This plot corresponds to Fig 3B from the published paper.
