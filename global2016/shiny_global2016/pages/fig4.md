**Fig 4. Drivers of change in OHI scores from 2012-2016 for a sampling of regions.**
Contribution of OHI goals to changes in annual Index scores for the 15 regions with largest increases and decreases in scores and 10 representative regions in between (separated by dark black lines). Light dark lines are the overall trend. Colored bars are the magnitude of change in each goal, either positive (to the right of the heavy black line) or negative (to the left). Note that minor change in an Index score can result from a wide range of possible combinations of changes in goal scores. See Fig G in S1 File for all countries.
