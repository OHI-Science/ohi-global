#### Coral Species Maps

<font size = 2>
IUCN range maps frequently include a 50 km coastal buffer for coastal species, which can distort predictions of presence for coastal species such as corals.  The [IUCN marine species range map dataset](http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/spatial-data)[2] includes maps for 562 species (394 of which are mapped in both IUCN[2] and AquaMaps[1] datasets).  According to IUCN habitat data for all corals included in the IUCN dataset, none of these mapped species are found below 200 m depth; only one species just reaches 200 m, and 94% occur only in waters shallower than 50 m.

This plot corresponds to Fig 3A from the published paper; the mini quad-plot corresponds to Fig S5 from the supporting information.
