Global OHI assessments require synthesizing highly heterogeneous information that is freely available from nearly one hundred sources. Data from each source are prepared and modeled using freely available coding and version control software. You may freely download and use any data, code, or instructional guides, but please see our [Citation Policy](http://ohi-science.org/citation-policy/).  

With each annual global assessment we have incrementally improved data processing and modeling methods based on new information, knowledge, and feedback. Thus, for annual scores to be comparable with previous years, we recalculate previous assessments with the most recent methods for each past assessment year. All code and most data are available online on GitHub.
