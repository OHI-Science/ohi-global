Ecosim models can be replicated over a spatial map grid (Ecospace) to allow exploration of policies such as marine protected areas, while accounting for spatial dispersal/advection effects.
The Ecopath approach and software has been under development for two decades, with Ecosim emerging in 1995, and Ecospace in 1998, leading to an integrated and widely applied package. We present an overview of the computational aspects of the Ecopath, Ecosim and Ecospace modules as they are implemented in the most recent software version. The paper summarizes the capabilities of the modeling system with respect to evaluating how fisheries and the environment impact ecosystems. We conclude by a warning about pitfalls in the use of the software for policy exploration.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem modelling has become a very important way to study marine ecosystems processes. A valuable tool for model development is the use of the software package Ecopath with Ecosim, which enables the construction of foodwebs and their simulation over time and space according to different scenarios. An important part of the process of ecosystem modelling is to compare results from the model with those from observations, followed by an analysis of the remaining sources of error. However, few of the currently developed Ecopath models have gone so far as to examine the uncertainty in analyses. Thus, it would be useful to address this problem, to clearly define the type of uncertainty that may be encountered in ecosystem modelling, and the means by which it may handled. Sensitivity analyses represent one solution by which one might address uncertainty in Ecopath with Ecosim. This approach functions by examining the sensitive elements as revealed in model results with differing scenarios of model-building and construction. In addition, other tools can also be used to perform uncertainty analysis routines. Examples are the Pedigree, Ecoranger and Autobalance tools, all of which are included the Ecopath software package. Furthermore, it is possible to combine these approaches with other modelling techniques in order to get an even stronger analysis of uncertainty. The purpose of this paper is to examine the strengths and weaknesses of these different approaches in addressing uncertainty.},

Previously we have shown that Excel can fit complex multiple functions to biological data, obtaining values equivalent to those returned by more specialized statistical or mathematical software. However, a disadvantage of using the Excel method was the inability to return confidence intervals for the computed parameters or the correlations between them. Using a simple Monte-Carlo procedure within the Excel spreadsheet (without recourse to programming), {SOLVER} can provide parameter estimates (up to 200 at a time) for multiple ‘virtual’ data sets, from which the required confidence intervals and correlation coefficients can be obtained. The general utility of the method is exemplified by applying it to the analysis of the growth of Listeria monocytogenes, the growth inhibition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by chlorhexidine and the further analysis of the electrophysiological data from the compound action potential of the rodent optic nerve.},

However, normally their application is determined by the discretization of the continuous variables. In this paper the naïve Bayes ({NB}) and tree augmented naïve Bayes ({TAN}) models are developed. They are based on Mixtures of Truncated Exponentials ({MTE}) designed to deal with discrete and continuous variables in the same network simultaneously without any restriction. The aim is to characterize the habitat of the spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca graeca), using several continuous environmental variables, and one discrete (binary) variable representing the presence or absence of the tortoise. These models are compared with the full discrete models and the results show a better classification rate for the continuous one. Therefore, the application of continuous models instead of discrete ones avoids loss of statistical information due to the discretization. Moreover, the results of the {TAN} continuous model show a more spatially accurate distribution of the tortoise. The species is located in the Doñana Natural Park, and in semiarid habitats. The proposed continuous models based on {MTEs} are valid for the study of species predictive distribution modelling.},

Yet, little information is available to help a researcher decide whether expert opinion is useful for their model, how an elicitation should be conducted, what the most relevant method for elicitation is and how this can be translated into prior distributions for analysis in a Bayesian model. In this study, we provide guidance in using expert knowledge in a transparent and credible manner to inform ecological models and ultimately natural resource and conservation decision-making. We illustrate the decisions faced when considering the use of expert knowledge in a model with the help of two real ecological case studies. These examples are explored further to examine the impact of expert knowledge through ‘priors’ in Bayesian modeling and specifically how to minimize potential bias. Finally, we make recommendations on the use of expert opinion in ecology. We believe if expert knowledge is elicited and incorporated into ecological models with the same level of rigour provided in the collection and use of empirical data, expert knowledge can increase the precision of models and facilitate informed decision-making in a cost-effective manner.},

Conducting further research to collect more empirical data may reduce that uncertainty. However, a sense of urgency often surrounds threatened or endangered species' management and decisions cannot wait until a definitive understanding of a species' ecology and distribution is obtained. Bayesian belief networks ({BBNs}) are proving to be valuable and flexible tools for integrating available expert knowledge and empirical data, thus strengthening conservation decisions when empirical data is lacking. We developed a {BBN} model and linked it to a geographical information system ({GIS}) to map habitat suitability for the Julia Creek dunnart (Sminthopsis douglasi), an endangered ground-dwelling mammal of the Mitchell grasslands of north-west Queensland, Australia. Expert knowledge, supported by field data, was used to determine the probabilistic influence of grazing pressure, density of the invasive shrub prickly acacia (Acacia nilotica), land tenure, soil variability and seasonal variability on dunnart habitat suitability. The model was then applied in a {GIS} to map the likelihood of suitable dunnart habitat. Sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the influence of environmental conditions and management options on habitat suitability. The study provides an example of how expert knowledge and limited empirical data can be combined within a {BBN} model, and linked to {GIS} data, to assist in recovery planning of endangered fauna populations.},

The framework provides information on the degree to which key climate change hazards are inherent in a particular coastal environment, and covers the hazards of ecosystem disruption, gradual inundation, salt water intrusion, erosion and flooding. The system includes a total of 565 individual hazard evaluations, each graduated into four different hazard levels based on a scientific literature review. The framework uses a simple assessment methodology with limited data and computing requirements, allowing for application in developing country settings.

Larger symbiont-bearing foraminifera constitute ubiquitous and prominent components of shallow water ecosystems, and range shifts of these important protists are likely to trigger changes in ecosystem functioning. We have used historical and newly acquired occurrence records to compute current range shifts of Amphistegina spp., a larger symbiont-bearing foraminifera, along the eastern coastline of Africa and compare them to analogous range shifts currently observed in the Mediterranean Sea. The study provides new evidence that amphisteginid foraminifera are rapidly progressing southwestward, closely approaching Port Edward (South Africa) at 31°S. To project future species distributions, we applied a species distribution model ({SDM}) based on ecological niche constraints of current distribution ranges. Our model indicates that further warming is likely to cause a continued range extension, and predicts dispersal along nearly the entire southeastern coast of Africa. The average rates of amphisteginid range shift were computed between 8 and 2.7 km year−1, and are projected to lead to a total southward range expansion of 267 km, or 2.4° latitude, in the year 2100. Our results corroborate findings from the fossil record that some larger symbiont-bearing foraminifera cope well with rising water temperatures and are beneficiaries of global climate change.},

Regardless of this uncertainty, flooding by tropical cyclones will increase as a result of accelerated sea-level rise.

Society must learn to live with a rapidly evolving shoreline that is increasingly prone to flooding from tropical cyclones. These impacts can be mitigated partly with adaptive strategies, which include careful stewardship of sediments and reductions in human-induced land subsidence.},

Two local-scale case studies were conducted in multi-objective marine and coastal spatial planning problems, one focusing on experimental artificial reef siting in the Mediterranean Sea and one on spatial rearrangement of aquaculture production in the Baltic Sea. In both cases similar analytical frameworks were utilized, yet the applied spatial {MCDA} techniques were tailored case-specifically according to local characteristics and the nature of the decision problems at hand. In both cases the joint use of {GIS} and {MCDA} was able to generate concrete, easily interpretable inputs for decision support via quantification and visualization of decision criteria, trade-offs, alternatives and uncertainty, thus supporting further use of {GIS}-based spatial decision support tools. Albeit such tools may provide valuable insight to {MSP} and {ICZM}, they also come with certain limitations which are commonly related to the quality of the input data and the used valuation criteria in situations that may contain a mixture of subjective and objective information. Based on the empirical findings, the applicability of spatial {MCDA} in these settings and in marine spatial planning in general is discussed.},

 needed to inform management decisions and regulate human pressures to meet the 
 objectives of environmental policies. This paper addresses some generic 
 methodological challenges and related uncertainties involved in marine ecosystem 
 assessment, using the central Baltic Sea as a case study. The objectives of good 
 environmental status of the Baltic Sea are largely focusing on biodiversity, 
 eutrophication and hazardous substances. In this paper, we conduct comparative 
 evaluations of the status of these three segments, by applying different 
 methodological approaches. Our analyses indicate that the assessment results are 
 sensitive to a selection of indicators for ecological quality objectives that 
 are affected by a broad spectrum of human activities and natural processes 
 (biodiversity), less so for objectives that are influenced by a relatively 
 narrow array of drivers (eutrophications, hazardous substances). The choice of 
 indicator aggregation rule appeared to be of essential importance for assessment 
 results for all three segments, whereas the hierarchical structure of indicators 
 had only a minor influence. Trend-based assessment was shown to be a useful 
 supplement to reference-based evaluation, being independent of the problems 
 related to defining reference values and indicator aggregation methodologies. 
 Results of this study will help in setting priorities for future efforts to 
 improve environmental assessments in the Baltic Sea and elsewhere, and to ensure 
 the transparency of the assessment procedure.},

We identified regime shifts in the pelagic ecosystem affecting multiple trophic levels during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The two regimes encompassing the years 1974–1987 and 1994–2007 were characterised by the opposite dominance of key fish and zooplankton species.},

We evaluated progress toward that goal for the world’s major terrestrial biomes, realms, and ecoregions. Total land area under any legal protection has increased from previous estimates to 12.9\%, a notable achievement, although only 5.8\% has strict protection for biodiversity. For biomes, protection ranges from 4\% to 25\%, with six of 14 biomes still below the 10\% level. Geographic patterns of protection have a distinct bias, with higher rates of protection in New World realms than Old World realms. Of the world’s terrestrial ecoregions, half do not meet the 2010 Target and 76\% have less than 10\% of their area strictly protected. Approximately 13\% of ecoregions have no strict protected areas. Recent years have seen an expansion of the protected area network, with an average of 0.13\% of the global land area added per year. Most of the expansion since 2003 though has been in Brazil, particularly the Amazon. Without major investments in conservation, spread across the world’s ecosystems, the world will likely miss the 2010 target.},

Both countries have had, until recently, stringent environmental policies limiting production volumes.

Thus, the strict Finnish environmental permit policy has not benefited the Baltic Sea environment, but has moved the production volumes and employment opportunities to other locations in the Baltic Sea and its drainage basin. By comparing the Finnish and Swedish fish farming governance systems, we found that in Sweden, various types of formal and informal interaction and practice have enhanced the achievement of balanced decisions. This has only rarely been the case in Finland, which features a more authoritative decision-making culture. On the other hand, increased communication across the Finnish administrative sectors raises future prospects for more holistic fish farming governance, which balances economic, social and environmental goals.},

The results show that frontline bureaucrats in Finland make more similar decisions than their colleagues in Sweden do. The lower regional variation can be explained by greater similarities in policy beliefs and by the fact that Finnish bureaucrats, in cases of uncertainties, consult the same implementation resource. Thus, by clarifying policy substance and by designing a central organisation for the provision of knowledge and advice, policy makers can counteract regional variation in fish stocking practices.},

We then used the software Marxan to generate cost-efficient reserve networks that represented every biotope in the Park. We asked what were the potential gains and losses in terms of fishing effort and species conservation of different planning scenarios. Given a conservation target of 10 \% representation of each biotope, the fishery need not lose more than 20 \% of its fishing grounds to give way to cost-efficient conservation of benthic diversity. No additional reserved area was needed to achieve conservation targets while minimizing fishing costs. We discuss the benefits of using {VMS} data for conservation planning.},

In the survey, respondents from Finland, Sweden, and Lithuania stated their preferences for improvements in marine characteristics chosen in conjunction with ecological changes modeled within study areas. Among citizens, the factor analysis revealed both supportive and opponent attitudes towards further marine protection and differences in perceptions for the importance of particular marine ecosystem services. The recreational aspect was notably more important in Lithuania than in Finland and Sweden. The nested logit analysis resulted in the willingness-to-pay estimates for the Finnish-Swedish archipelago that are considerably higher among the Swedish than the Finnish population.

	abstract = {Although the number and extent of protected areas ({PAs}) are continuously increasing, their coverage of global biodiversity, as well as criteria and targets that underline their selection, warrants scrutiny. As a case study, we use a global dataset of sea turtle nesting sites (n = 2991) to determine the extent to which the existing global {PA} network encompasses nesting habitats (beaches) that are vital for the persistence of the seven sea turtle species. The majority of nesting sites (87\%) are in the tropics, and are mainly hosted by developing countries. Developing countries contain 82\% nesting sites, which provide lower protection coverage compared to developed countries. {PAs} encompass 25\% of all nesting sites, of which 78\% are in marine {PAs}. At present, most nesting sites in {PAs} with {IUCN} ratification receive high protection. We identified the countries that provide the highest and lowest nesting site protection coverage, and detected gaps in species-level protection effort within countries. No clear trend in protection coverage was found in relation to gross domestic product, the Global Peace Index or sea turtle regional management units; however, countries in crisis (civil unrest, war or natural catastrophes) provided slightly higher protection coverage of all countries. We conclude that global sea turtle resilience against threats spanning temperate to tropical regions require representative {PA} coverage at the species level within countries. This work is anticipated to function as a first step towards identifying specific countries or regions that should receive higher conservation interest by national and international bodies.},

	abstract = {Coastal and ocean planning comprises a broad field of practice. The goals, political processes, and approaches applied to planning initiatives may vary widely. However, all planning processes ultimately require adequate information on both the biophysical and social attributes of a planning region. In coastal and ocean planning practice, there are well-established methods to assess biophysical attributes; however, less is understood about the role and assessment of social data. We conducted the first global assessment of the incorporation of social data in coastal and ocean planning. We drew on a comprehensive review of planning initiatives and a survey of coastal and ocean practitioners. There was significantly more incorporation of social data in multiuse versus conservation-oriented planning. Practitioners engaged a wide range of social data, including governance, economic, and cultural attributes of planning regions and human impacts data. Less attention was given to ecosystem services and social–ecological linkages, both of which could improve coastal and ocean planning practice. Although practitioners recognize the value of social data, little funding is devoted to its collection and incorporation in plans. Increased capacity and sophistication in acquiring critical social and ecological data for planning is necessary to develop plans for more resilient coastal and ocean ecosystems and communities. We suggest that improving social data monitoring, and in particular spatial social data, to complement biophysical data, is necessary for providing holistic information for decision-support tools and other methods. Moving beyond people as impacts to people as beneficiaries, through ecosystem services assessments, holds much potential to better incorporate the tenets of ecosystem-based management into coastal and ocean planning by providing targets for linked biodiversity conservation and human welfare outcomes.

	abstract = {Many global indicators rank countries according to valued goods such as freedom, wealth, or happiness, but they all share the same flaw: they neglect the importance of rich and diverse social relations for human well-being. The Harmony Index ({HI}) is an effort to remedy this flaw. It measures four types of relations that matter for human well-being. The {HI} attempts to measure the extent of peaceful order and respect for diversity—what Confucian thinkers call harmony—within each relation, and ranks countries according to the score for overall harmony. This inaugural {HI} made use of comprehensive and reliable comparative data for 27 countries. Our findings show that small and relatively wealthy countries tend to be more harmonious countries. Compared to other leading global indices, however, the Harmony Index is less influenced by gross domestic product per capita and by the extent of democracy in a country. Population has a greater impact on harmony than either wealth or political system. We constructed another {HI} with fewer measurements for family well-being but covering a broader range of countries. A chart with 43 countries demonstrates that it is possible to achieve a high score on the {HI} without a high level of wealth or democracy. A detailed breakdown of the findings allows us to draw some tentative policy implications at the end of the report. Establishing and nourishing harmonious social relations and a non-destructive approach to the environment is a goal shared by most of the world’s cultures, ethical systems, and religions, and a harmony index can and should be used as a key indicator of social progress and regress.},

Chinese top leaders have realized to increase the peoples’ income, improve quality of life and construct a “harmonious society” as key missions especially in recent 10 years. How to measure a harmonious society is one important topic as different measures may lead to different development policies. This paper outlines over 10 indices relevant to measure a harmonious society. Some are global indicators, while some are contributed by domestic researchers and arouse debates. Most of those indicators require conducting surveys on social attitudes under micro levels, which is always time consuming with problem of data quality. As Internet technology advances provide ways to record and disseminate fresh community ideas and thoughts conveniently, detecting topics or emotions from on-line public opinions is becoming a trend or one supplement way to overcome those data acquisition problems. This paper discusses one approach to on-line societal risk perception using hot search words and {BBS} posts. Such a trial aims to provide another way to societal risk perception different from those in traditional socio psychology studies. Challenges are also indicated.},

	abstract = {Deoxygenation is a global problem in coastal and open regions of the ocean, and has led to expanding areas of oxygen minimum zones and coastal hypoxia. The recent expansion of hypoxia in coastal ecosystems has been primarily attributed to global warming and enhanced nutrient input from land and atmosphere. The largest anthropogenically induced hypoxic area in the world is the Baltic Sea, where the relative importance of physical forcing versus eutrophication is still debated. We have analyzed water column oxygen and salinity profiles to reconstruct oxygen and stratification conditions over the last 115 y and compare the influence of both climate and anthropogenic forcing on hypoxia. We report a 10-fold increase of hypoxia in the Baltic Sea and show that this is primarily linked to increased inputs of nutrients from land, although increased respiration from higher temperatures during the last two decades has contributed to worsening oxygen conditions. Although shifts in climate and physical circulation are important factors modulating the extent of hypoxia, further nutrient reductions in the Baltic Sea will be necessary to reduce the ecosystems impacts of deoxygenation.},

The contributions of the elements of the marine economy to regional economic growth in China are deduced by using a multi-factor production function model with a constant elasticity of substitution. The results indicate that the contribution of the Chinese marine economy to the national economy increased from 6.46\% to 13.83\% between 2000 and 2011, and the average annual growth rate during that same period was 7.17\%. This contribution mainly resulted from marine capital׳s contribution to the national economy, which amounted to roughly two-thirds of the marine economy׳s contribution to the national economy. With respect to regional differentiation, the contributions of the marine economy to the regional economies in China are ranked by region from greatest to least as follows: the Circum-Bohai Sea Region, the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta region. Finally, Liaoning׳s marine economy made the largest contribution to the national economy from 2000 to 2011.},

And the index of coastline utilization degree ({ICUD}) was defined and calculated for mainland coastline at national, provincial and local scales respectively. It turned out that, 1) over the last 70 years, especially during the last two decades in China, the {ICUD} increased continuously and dramatically, which shows that the impacts of human beings on mainland coastline increased incessantly. 2) Significant spatial patterns and temporal variations of the {ICUD} could be observed, in specific, the Yangtze River delta had much higher {ICUD} in the early stages; however the {ICUD} in the Pearl River delta and Circum Bohai Bay increased more dramatically than the Yangtze River delta in the last two decades. 3) At national and provincial scales, the intensive and accelerated exploitation of coastline, following the continual decrease of natural coastline over the last 70 years had determined the temporal trends of {ICUD}. However, the spatio-temporal patterns of {ICUD} exhibited much complicated characteristics at local scale because both human activities and physical factors had significant impacts on coastline changes. 4) Overall, the {ICUD} effectively revealed the spatio-temporal characteristics of mainland coastline changes and impacts of human activities on coastline in China. It will be helpful for China's {ICZM} decision makings to monitor the mainland coastline changes and analyze its dynamics by {ICUD}.},

Our assessment also included data on social and ecological pressures on biodiversity as well as variables that indicate whether good governance is in place to reduce them. Thus, our index is a social as well as ecological measure of the current and likely future status of biodiversity. As part of our analyses, we set explicit reference points or targets that provide benchmarks for success and allow for comparative assessment of current conditions. Overall country-level scores ranged from 43 to 95 on a scale of 1 to 100, but countries that scored high for species did not necessarily score high for habitats. Although most current status scores were relatively high, likely future status scores for biodiversity were much lower in most countries due to negative trends for both species and habitats. We also found a strong positive relationship between the Human Development Index and resilience measures that could promote greater sustainability by reducing pressures. This relationship suggests that many developing countries lack effective governance, further jeopardizing their ability to maintain species and habitats in the future.},

We show how trends in demography and in several local and global anthropogenic stressors are progressively degrading capacity of coastal waters to sustain these people. Far more effective approaches to environmental management are needed if the loss in provision of ecosystem goods and services is to be stemmed. We propose expanded use of marine spatial planning as a framework for more effective, pragmatic management based on ocean zones to accommodate conflicting uses. This would force the holistic, regional-scale reconciliation of food security, livelihoods, and conservation that is needed. Transforming how countries manage coastal resources will require major change in policy and politics, implemented with sufficient flexibility to accommodate societal variations. Achieving this change is a major challenge – one that affects the lives of one fifth of humanity.},

We combined new radar altimeter measurements from satellites {CryoSat}-2 and Jason-1 with existing data to construct a global marine gravity model that is two times more accurate than previous models. We found an extinct spreading ridge in the Gulf of Mexico, a major propagating rift in the South Atlantic Ocean, abyssal hill fabric on slow-spreading ridges, and thousands of previously uncharted seamounts. These discoveries allow us to understand regional tectonic processes and highlight the importance of satellite-derived gravity models as one of the primary tools for the investigation of remote ocean basins.
High-resolution tectonic solutions
Detailed topographic maps are available for only a small fraction of the ocean floor, severely limited by the number of ship crossings. Global maps constructed using satellite-derived gravity data, in contrast, are limited in the size of features they can resolve. Sandwell et al. present a new marine gravity model that greatly improves this resolution (see the Perspective by Hwang and Chang). They identify several previously unknown tectonic features, including extinct spreading ridges in the Gulf of Mexico and numerous uncharted seamounts.

We have reviewed, from ecological and management perspectives, the approaches for aggregating and integrating currently available for marine status assessment in Europe and other regions of the world. Advantages and shortcomings of the different alternatives are highlighted. We provide some guidance on the steps toward defining rules for aggregation and integration of information at multiple levels of ecosystem organization, providing recommendations on when using specific rules in the assessment.

	abstract = {We used expert elicitation to examine potential responses of eelgrass to several restoration strategies in Puget Sound. Restoration strategies included shoreline armor removal and modification, removal and modification of overwater structures, and efforts to improve water clarity via reductions in anthropogenic nutrient and sediment loadings. Expert responses indicated a general belief that reducing stressors would increase eelgrass cover; however, responses varied greatly among stressors. Our analyses revealed that removal of overwater structures, nutrient loading and shoreline armoring will have significantly larger effects on eelgrass recovery than would removal of sediment loading, with removal of overwater structures having the largest effect. We then used a probabilistic model to estimate what actions, singularly or in combination, could yield a large increase in eelgrass cover. Reducing single stressors could, in theory, result in recovery of eelgrass in Puget Sound; however, the magnitude of actions required would be so great that it is likely not practical. In contrast, we identified combinations of smaller reductions of stressors that could achieve significant eelgrass recovery. For example, a 40\% reduction in overwater structures, combined with 20\% reductions in shoreline armor, and nutrient and sediment loadings, was predicted to be one of the more feasible combinations of actions for meeting the target. The importance of eelgrass to Puget requires prompt input of scientific advice, and this work fills an important knowledge gap in the face of rapidly approaching legislative deadlines. While coded expert opinion of the sort we use here is a weak substitute for data, our work clarifies the current extent of scientific uncertainty that can guide management action in the near term and scientific research in the long term.},

Despite significant progress in characterizing socioecological complexity, including important inroads for measuring human wellbeing through ecosystem services approaches, cultural interactions with ecosystems remain poorly understood. Inadequate knowledge of cultural dimensions of ecosystems challenges the ability of conservation professionals to include these considerations in their programs. Ecosystem-based conservation without cultural considerations is not only insufficient, it risks producing unaccounted negative impacts to communities and misses an opportunity to build culturally meaningful alternatives. This mini review of relevant social science identifies five key cultural dimensions of ecosystems, highlighting examples from coastal North America. These key dimensions are: meanings, values, and identities; knowledge and practice; governance and access; livelihoods; and interactions with biophysical environments. We outline guiding principles for addressing these connections in integrated conservation research and application. Finally, we discuss potential methodologies to help improve interdisciplinary assessment and monitoring of cultural dimensions of conservation.},

Nonetheless, how beliefs about the scope and severity of different types of environmental concerns shape support for management interventions are less clear. Using data from a telephone survey of residents of the Puget Sound region of Washington, we investigate how perceptions of the severity of different coastal environmental problems, along with other social factors, affect attitudes about policy options. We find that self-assessed environmental understanding and views about the seriousness of pollution, habitat loss, and salmon declines are only weakly related. Among survey respondents, women, young people, and those who believe pollution threatens Puget Sound are more likely to support policy measures such as increased enforcement and spending on restoration. Conversely, self-identified Republicans and individuals who view current regulations as ineffective tend to oppose governmental actions aimed at protecting and restoring Puget Sound. Support for one policy measure--tax credits for environmentally-friendly business practices--is not significantly affected by political party affiliation. These findings demonstrate that environmental awareness can influence public support for environmental policy tools. However, the nature of particular management interventions and other social forces can have important mitigating effects and need to be considered by practitioners attempting to develop environment-related social indicators and generate consensus around the need for action to address environmental problems.[{PUBLICATION} {ABSTRACT}]},

Analyses of the science needed to manage human uses of ecosystem services have concentrated on terrestrial ecosystems. Our focus is on the provision of multidisciplinary data needed to inform adaptive, ecosystem-based approaches ({EBAs}) for maintaining coastal ecosystem services based on comparative ecosystem analyses. Key indicators of pressures on coastal ecosystems, ecosystem states and the impacts of changes in states on services are identified for monitoring and analysis at a global coastal network of sentinel sites nested in the ocean-climate observing system. Biodiversity is targeted as the “master” indicator because of its importance to a broad spectrum of services. Ultimately, successful implementation of {EBAs} will depend on establishing integrated, holistic approaches to ocean governance that oversee the development of integrated, operational ocean observing systems based on the data and information requirements specified by a broad spectrum of stakeholders for sustainable development. Sustained engagement of such a spectrum of stakeholders on a global scale is not feasible. The global coastal network will need to be customized locally and regionally based on priorities established by stakeholders in their respective regions. The E.U. Marine Strategy Framework Directive and the U.S. Recommendations of the Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force are important examples of emerging regional scale approaches. The effectiveness of these policies will depend on the co-evolution of ocean policy and the observing system under the auspices of integrated ocean governance.},

Integrated assessments of ocean health are needed to understand the condition of a range of benefits that humans derive from marine systems and to evaluate where attention should be focused to improve the health of these systems. Here we describe the first such assessment for Brazil at both national and state levels. We applied the Ocean Health Index framework, which evaluates ten public goals for healthy oceans. Despite refinements of input data and model formulations, the national score of 60 (out of 100) was highly congruent with the previous global assessment for Brazil of 62. Variability in scores among coastal states was most striking for goals related to mariculture, protected areas, tourism, and clean waters. Extractive goals, including Food Provision, received low scores relative to habitat-related goals, such as Biodiversity. This study demonstrates the applicability of the Ocean Health Index at a regional scale, and its usefulness in highlighting existing data and knowledge gaps and identifying key policy and management recommendations. To improve Brazil's ocean health, this study suggests that future actions should focus on: enhancing fisheries management, expanding marine protected areas, and monitoring coastal habitats.},

This paper describes a systematic approach to eliciting such preferences, illustrated through a regional application of the Ocean Health Index in the California Current. The Index provides an ideal case study as it includes a comprehensive set of goals designed to assess the benefits people derive from coasts and oceans. The approach leverages the strengths of two different methods for eliciting preferences, one based on random utility theory and the other on analytical deliberative methodologies. Results showed that the methods were accessible to individuals with diverse backgrounds and, in this case, revealed surprising consensus about fundamental values that may have been missed in deliberations around a specific action, rather than evaluating a spectrum of management priorities. Specifically, individuals, even extractive users, assigned higher weights to cultural and conservation goals compared to extractive ones. The approach offers a general procedure for eliciting explicit preferences through constructive deliberations among diverse stakeholders.},

We demonstrate how a global ocean health index framework can be applied to a data-limited scenario and modified to incorporate the objectives and context of a developing island nation like Fiji. Although these changes did not have a major effect on the total index value, two goals had substantial changes. The artisanal opportunities goal increased from 46 to 92 as a result of changes to the model for Fiji, which looks at the stock status of artisanally-caught species. The lasting special places sub-goal decreased from 96 to 48, due to the use of Fiji-specific data and reference points that allow policymakers to track progress towards national goals. Fiji scored high for the tourism and recreation goal, but low for the production-oriented natural products goal and mariculture sub-goal, which may reflect national values and development priorities. By measuring ocean health across a portfolio of goals and re-calculating scores over time, we can better understand potential trade-offs between goals. Our approach for measuring ocean health in Fiji highlights pathways for improvements and approaches that may help guide other data-limited countries in assessing ocean health.},

	abstract = {Meeting of Minds
The performance of humans across a range of different kinds of cognitive tasks has been encapsulated as a common statistical factor called g or general intelligence factor. What intelligence actually is, is unclear and hotly debated, yet there is a reproducible association of g with performance outcomes, such as income and academic achievement. Woolley et al. (p. 686, published online 30 September) report a psychometric methodology for quantifying a factor termed “collective intelligence” (c), which reflects how well groups perform on a similarly diverse set of group problem-solving tasks. The primary contributors to c appear to be the g factors of the group members, along with a propensity toward social sensitivity—in essence, how well individuals work with others.
Psychologists have repeatedly shown that a single statistical factor—often called “general intelligence”—emerges from the correlations among people’s performance on a wide variety of cognitive tasks. But no one has systematically examined whether a similar kind of “collective intelligence” exists for groups of people. In two studies with 699 people, working in groups of two to five, we find converging evidence of a general collective intelligence factor that explains a group’s performance on a wide variety of tasks. This “c factor” is not strongly correlated with the average or maximum individual intelligence of group members but is correlated with the average social sensitivity of group members, the equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking, and the proportion of females in the group.
A metric for group performance on a battery of cognitive tasks yields a group intelligence quantity: collective intelligence.

But it has been about more than just meeting; the importance of resident scientists at synthesis centers was also evident, in that including synthesis-center residents in geographically distributed working groups further increased productivity. Moreover, multi-institutional collaboration, normally detrimental to productivity, was positively associated with productivity in this stimulating environment. Finally, participation in synthesis groups significantly increased scientists' collaborative propensity and visibility, positively affecting scientific careers and potentially increasing the capacity of the scientific community to leverage synthesis for enhanced scientific understanding.},

Although the importance of size structure for demography is widely recognized, many models either omit it entirely or include only coarse approximations.


* Here, we introduce the plant package, an extensible framework for modelling size- and trait-structured demography, ecology and evolution in simulated forests. At its core, plant is an individual-based model where plant physiology and demography are mediated by traits. Individual plants from multiple species can be grown in isolation, in patches of competing plants or in metapopulations under a disturbance regime. These dynamics can be integrated into metapopulation-level estimates of invasion fitness and vegetation structure. Because fitness emerges as a function of traits, plant provides a novel arena for exploring eco-evolutionary dynamics.


* plant is an open source R package and is available at github.com/traitecoevo/plant. Accessed from R, the core routines in plant are written in C++. The package provides for alternative physiologies and for capturing trade-offs among parameters. A detailed test suite is provided to ensure correct behaviour of the code.


* plant provides a transparent platform for investigating how physiological rules and functional trade-offs interact with competition and disturbance regimes to influence vegetation demography, structure and diversity.},

In this position paper, we define the secure provenance problem and argue that it is of vital importance in numerous applications. We then discuss a select few of the issues related to ensuring the privacy and integrity of provenance information.},

	abstract = {Science depends on collaboration, result reproduction, and the development of supporting software tools. Each of these requires careful management of software versions. We present a unified model for installing, managing, and publishing software contexts in R. It introduces the package manifest as a central data structure for representing version specific, decentralized package cohorts. The manifest points to package sources on arbitrary hosts and in various forms, including tarballs and directories under version control. We provide a high-level interface for creating and switching between side-by-side package libraries derived from manifests. Finally, we extend package installation to support the retrieval of exact package versions as indicated by manifests, and to maintain provenance for installed packages. The provenance information enables the user to publish libraries or sessions as manifests, hence completing the loop between publication and deployment. We have implemented this model across two software packages, switchr and {GRANbase}, and have released the source code under the Artistic 2.0 license.},

	abstract = {The field of ecology is poised to take advantage of emerging technologies that facilitate the gathering, analyzing, and sharing of data, methods, and results. The concept of transparency at all stages of the research process, coupled with free and open access to data, code, and papers, constitutes “open science.” Despite the many benefits of an open approach to science, a number of barriers to entry exist that may prevent researchers from embracing openness in their own work. Here we describe several key shifts in mindset that underpin the transition to more open science. These shifts in mindset include thinking about data stewardship rather than data ownership, embracing transparency throughout the data life-cycle and project duration, and accepting critique in public. Though foreign and perhaps frightening at first, these changes in thinking stand to benefit the field of ecology by fostering collegiality and broadening access to data and findings. We present an overview of tools and best practices that can enable these shifts in mindset at each stage of the research process, including tools to support data management planning and reproducible analyses, strategies for soliciting constructive feedback throughout the research process, and methods of broadening access to final research products.},

Nearly every field is affected, from clinical trials and neuroimaging, to economics and computer science. Obvious solutions include more research on statistical and behavioral fixes for irreproducibility, activism for policy changes, and demanding more pre-registration and data sharing from grantees. Two Perspectives in this issue (pp. 1420 and 1422) describe how journals and academic institutions can foster a culture of reproducibility.

	abstract = {Recent research with face-to-face groups found that a measure of general group effectiveness (called “collective intelligence”) predicted a group’s performance on a wide range of different tasks. The same research also found that collective intelligence was correlated with the individual group members’ ability to reason about the mental states of others (an ability called “Theory of Mind” or “{ToM}”). Since {ToM} was measured in this work by a test that requires participants to “read” the mental states of others from looking at their eyes (the “Reading the Mind in the Eyes” test), it is uncertain whether the same results would emerge in online groups where these visual cues are not available. Here we find that: (1) a collective intelligence factor characterizes group performance approximately as well for online groups as for face-to-face groups; and (2) surprisingly, the {ToM} measure is equally predictive of collective intelligence in both face-to-face and online groups, even though the online groups communicate only via text and never see each other at all. This provides strong evidence that {ToM} abilities are just as important to group performance in online environments with limited nonverbal cues as they are face-to-face. It also suggests that the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test measures a deeper, domain-independent aspect of social reasoning, not merely the ability to recognize facial expressions of mental states.},

	abstract = {Indicators are increasingly used to measure environmental systems; however, they are often criticized for failing to measure and describe uncertainty. Uncertainty is particularly difficult to evaluate and communicate in the case of composite indicators which aggregate many indicators of ecosystem condition. One of the ongoing goals of the Ocean Health Index ({OHI}) has been to improve our approach to dealing with missing data, which is a major source of uncertainty. Here we: (1) quantify the potential influence of gapfilled data on index scores from the 2015 global {OHI} assessment; (2) develop effective methods of tracking, quantifying, and communicating this information; and (3) provide general guidance for implementing gapfilling procedures for existing and emerging indicators, including regional {OHI} assessments. For the overall {OHI} global index score, the percent contribution of gapfilled data was relatively small (18.5\%); however, it varied substantially among regions and goals. In general, smaller territorial jurisdictions and the food provision and tourism and recreation goals required the most gapfilling. We found the best approach for managing gapfilled data was to mirror the general framework used to organize, calculate, and communicate the Index data and scores. Quantifying gapfilling provides a measure of the reliability of the scores for different regions and components of an indicator. Importantly, this information highlights the importance of the underlying datasets used to calculate composite indicators and can inform and incentivize future data collection.},

One reason for the belated adoption of informatics approaches in ecology is the breadth of ecologically pertinent data (from genes to the biosphere) and its highly heterogeneous nature. The variety of formats, logical structures, and sampling methods in ecology create significant challenges. Cultural barriers further impede progress, especially for the creation and adoption of data standards. Here we describe informatics frameworks for ecology, from subject-specific data warehouses, to generic data collections that use detailed metadata descriptions and formal ontologies to catalog and cross-reference information. Combining these approaches with automated data integration techniques and scientific workflow systems will maximize the value of data and open new frontiers for research in ecology.},

	abstract = {International and regional policies aimed at managing ocean ecosystem health need quantitative and comprehensive indices to synthesize information from a variety of sources, consistently measure progress, and communicate with key constituencies and the public. Here we present the second annual global assessment of the Ocean Health Index, reporting current scores and annual changes since 2012, recalculated using updated methods and data based on the best available science, for 221 coastal countries and territories. The Index measures performance of ten societal goals for healthy oceans on a quantitative scale of increasing health from 0 to 100, and combines these scores into a single Index score, for each country and globally. The global Index score improved one point (from 67 to 68), while many country-level Index and goal scores had larger changes. Per-country Index scores ranged from 41–95 and, on average, improved by 0.06 points (range -8 to +12). Globally, average scores increased for individual goals by as much as 6.5 points (coastal economies) and decreased by as much as 1.2 points (natural products). Annual updates of the Index, even when not all input data have been updated, provide valuable information to scientists, policy makers, and resource managers because patterns and trends can emerge from the data that have been updated. Changes of even a few points indicate potential successes (when scores increase) that merit recognition, or concerns (when scores decrease) that may require mitigative action, with changes of more than 10–20 points representing large shifts that deserve greater attention. Goal scores showed remarkably little covariance across regions, indicating low redundancy in the Index, such that each goal delivers information about a different facet of ocean health. Together these scores provide a snapshot of global ocean health and suggest where countries have made progress and where a need for further improvement exists.},

Managers and policymakers require such information to make strategic decisions and monitor progress towards management objectives. Here we calculate and map recent change over 5 years in cumulative impacts to marine ecosystems globally from fishing, climate change, and ocean- and land-based stressors. Nearly 66\% of the ocean and 77\% of national jurisdictions show increased human impact, driven mostly by climate change pressures. Five percent of the ocean is heavily impacted with increasing pressures, requiring management attention. Ten percent has very low impact with decreasing pressures. Our results provide large-scale guidance about where to prioritize management efforts and affirm the importance of addressing climate change to maintain and improve the condition of marine ecosystems.

In particular, seagrass meadows are negatively affected by impacts accruing from the billion or more people who live within 50 km of them. Seagrass meadows provide important ecosystem services, including an estimated \$1.9 trillion per year in the form of nutrient cycling; an order of magnitude enhancement of coral reef fish productivity; a habitat for thousands of fish, bird, and invertebrate species; and a major food source for endangered dugong, manatee, and green turtle. Although individual impacts from coastal development, degraded water quality, and climate change have been documented, there has been no quantitative global assessment of seagrass loss until now. Our comprehensive global assessment of 215 studies found that seagrasses have been disappearing at a rate of 110 km2 yr−1 since 1980 and that 29\% of the known areal extent has disappeared since seagrass areas were initially recorded in 1879. Furthermore, rates of decline have accelerated from a median of 0.9\% yr−1 before 1940 to 7\% yr−1 since 1990. Seagrass loss rates are comparable to those reported for mangroves, coral reefs, and tropical rainforests and place seagrass meadows among the most threatened ecosystems on earth.},

In this paper, we provide an updated estimate based on updated unit ecosystem service values and land use change estimates between 1997 and 2011. We also address some of the critiques of the 1997 paper. Using the same methods as in the 1997 paper but with updated data, the estimate for the total global ecosystem services in 2011 is \$125 trillion/yr (assuming updated unit values and changes to biome areas) and \$145 trillion/yr (assuming only unit values changed), both in 2007 \${US}. From this we estimated the loss of eco-services from 1997 to 2011 due to land use change at \$4.3–20.2 trillion/yr, depending on which unit values are used. Global estimates expressed in monetary accounting units, such as this, are useful to highlight the magnitude of eco-services, but have no specific decision-making context. However, the underlying data and models can be applied at multiple scales to assess changes resulting from various scenarios and policies. We emphasize that valuation of eco-services (in whatever units) is not the same as commodification or privatization.

The loss of animal species in terrestrial environments has been well documented and is continuing. Loss of species in marine environments has been slower than in terrestrial systems, but appears to be increasing rapidly. {McCauley} et al. review the recent patterns of species decline and loss in marine environments. Though they note many worrying declines, they also highlight approaches that might allow us to prevent the type of massive defaunation that has occurred on land.

Structured Abstract
{BACKGROUND} Comparing patterns of terrestrial and marine defaunation helps to place human impacts on marine fauna in context and to navigate toward recovery. Defauna­tion began in earnest tens of thousands of years later in the oceans than it did on land. Although defaunation has been less severe in the oceans than on land, our effects on marine animals are increasing in pace and impact. Humans have caused few complete extinctions in the sea, but we are responsible for many ecological, commercial, and local extinctions. Despite our late start, humans have already powerfully changed virtually all major marine ecosystems.
{ADVANCES} Humans have profoundly decreased the abundance of both large (e.g., whales) and small (e.g., anchovies) marine fauna. Such declines can generate waves of ecological change that travel both up and down ma­rine food webs and can alter ocean ecosystem functioning. Human harvesters have also been a major force of evolutionary change in the oceans and have reshaped the genetic structure of marine animal populations. Climate change threatens to accelerate marine defaunation over the next century. The high mobility of many marine animals offers some increased, though limited, capacity for marine species to respond to climate stress, but it also exposes many species to increased risk from other stressors. Because humans are intensely reliant on ocean ecosystems for food and other ecosystem services, we are deeply affected by all of these forecasted changes. Three lessons emerge when comparing the marine and terrestrial defaunation experiences: (i) today’s low rates of marine extinction may be the prelude to a major extinction pulse, similar to that observed on land during the industrial revolution, as the footprint of human ocean use widens; (ii) effectively slowing ocean defaunation requires both protected areas and careful management of the intervening ocean matrix; and (iii) the terrestrial experience and current trends in ocean use suggest that habitat destruction is likely to become an increasingly dominant threat to ocean wildlife over the next 150 years.
{OUTLOOK} Wildlife populations in the oceans have been badly damaged by human activity. Nevertheless, marine fauna generally are in better condition than terrestrial fauna: Fewer marine animal extinctions have occurred; many geographic ranges have shrunk less; and numerous ocean ecosystems remain more wild than terrestrial ecosystems. Consequently, meaningful rehabilitation of affected marine animal populations remains within the reach of managers. Human dependency on marine wildlife and the linked fate of marine and terrestrial fauna necessitate that we act quickly to slow the advance of marine defaunation.

The marine defaunation experience is much less advanced, even though humans have been harvesting ocean wildlife for thousands of years. The recent industrialization of this harvest, however, initiated an era of intense marine wildlife declines. If left unmanaged, we predict that marine habitat alteration, along with climate change (colored bar: {IPCC} warming), will exacerbate marine defaunation.
Marine defaunation, or human-caused animal loss in the oceans, emerged forcefully only hundreds of years ago, whereas terrestrial defaunation has been occurring far longer. Though humans have caused few global marine extinctions, we have profoundly affected marine wildlife, altering the functioning and provisioning of services in every ocean. Current ocean trends, coupled with terrestrial defaunation lessons, suggest that marine defaunation rates will rapidly intensify as human use of the oceans industrializes. Though protected areas are a powerful tool to harness ocean productivity, especially when designed with future climate in mind, additional management strategies will be required. Overall, habitat degradation is likely to intensify as a major driver of marine wildlife loss. Proactive intervention can avert a marine defaunation disaster of the magnitude observed on land.},

International shipping, followed by aquaculture, represent the major means of introduction.

	abstract = {A composite index is a combination of various sources of information known as indicators, measured in or of a system in order to provide a summary of the system that is itself not directly measurable. For the index to be useful and meaningful, its construction requires careful consideration of several important aspects of the potentially disparate and multiple indicators that help convey its meaning. In general there are five key steps that should be considered when constructing a composite index, one of which is how the indicators should be weighted and aggregated to form the index. This step is critical in index construction, yet there seems to be no documented evidence about making objective weighting and aggregation choices in constructing indices so that they are robust. This sort of evidence would be particularly helpful for deciding whether any of the existing indices for assessing stream health would suffice for assessing the health of a given set of stream data or whether developing a new index is warranted. Thus we designed a simulation study to test the robustness and sensitivity of the weighting and aggregation choices in four existing stream health indices. The four indices mainly differed in their choices of standardization and weighting and aggregation techniques. The three main general conclusions about these existing approaches are the recommendation to use bootstrapping to approximate the distribution of the stream health index; the standardization technique employed should use all of the available indicators; and the use of reference (or pristine) sites as a standardization tool is not essential. Since the study is based on artificial data, the findings should be applicable and relevant to indices in other fields of study such as economics, social sciences, finance and medicine.},

	abstract = {Complex mathematical and computational models are used in all areas of society and technology and yet model based science is increasingly contested or refuted, especially when models are applied to controversial themes in domains such as health, the environment or the economy. More stringent standards of proofs are demanded from model-based numbers, especially when these numbers represent potential financial losses, threats to human health or the state of the environment. Quantitative sensitivity analysis is generally agreed to be one such standard. Mathematical models are good at mapping assumptions into inferences. A modeller makes assumptions about laws pertaining to the system, about its status and a plethora of other, often arcane, system variables and internal model settings. To what extent can we rely on the model-based inference when most of these assumptions are fraught with uncertainties? Global Sensitivity Analysis offers an accessible treatment of such problems via  quantitative sensitivity analysis, beginning with the first principles and guiding the reader through the full range of recommended practices with a rich set of solved exercises. The text explains the motivation for sensitivity analysis, reviews the required statistical concepts, and provides a guide to potential applications.

	abstract = {Estuaries are an important link between terrestrial and marine ecosystems, so assessing their health and what influences it can help guide future ecosystem monitoring and management. But estuaries can be complex and dynamic systems, so summarising health by a single score or grade raises questions about interpretation, variability, sensitivity and confidence. Such questions may include how variable is the score for a particular waterway, how sensitive is the score to seemingly benign decisions taken to reach that score, and how different is the B grade of one waterway to the C scored by an adjacent waterway. Focusing on a specific estuarine health index, we quantified two different sources of variation in its construction and examined how they contributed to the variability of the final score. We found that quantifying the variability in two steps of the index construction enabled us to make more informed inferences about the index and its bearing on an overall report card score for an estuary. By highlighting uncertainty in an estuarine health index, we are improving its inferential value and enabling more defensible decision-making about current and future management and amelioration of an estuary’s health and function.},

These approaches are advantageous to traditional techniques (e.g. deletion and mean imputation techniques) because they require less stringent assumptions and mitigate the pitfalls of traditional techniques. This article explains the theoretical underpinnings of missing data analyses, gives an overview of traditional missing data techniques, and provides accessible descriptions of maximum likelihood and multiple imputation. In particular, this article focuses on maximum likelihood estimation and presents two analysis examples from the Longitudinal Study of American Youth data. One of these examples includes a description of the use of auxiliary variables. Finally, the paper illustrates ways that researchers can use intentional, or planned, missing data to enhance their research designs.},

	abstract = {Sustainable development has broad appeal and little specificity, but some combination of development and environment as well as equity is found in many attempts to describe it. However, proponents of sustainable development differ in their emphases on what is to be sustained, what is to be developed, how to link environment and development, and for how long a time. Despite the persistent definitional ambiguities associated with sustainable development, much work (over 500 efforts) has been devoted to developing quantitative indicators of sustainable development. The emphasis on sustainability indicators has multiple motivations that include decision making and management, advocacy, participation and consensus building, and research and analysis. We select a dozen prominent examples and use this review to highlight their similarities and differences in definition of sustainable development, motivation, process, and technical methods. We conclude that there are no indicator sets that are universally accepted, backed by compelling theory, rigorous data collection and analysis, and influential in policy. This is due to the ambiguity of sustainable development, the plurality of purpose in characterizing and measuring sustainable development, and the confusion of terminology, data, and methods of measurement. A major step in reducing such confusion would be the acceptance of distinctions in terminology, data, and methods. Toward this end, we propose an analytical framework that clearly distinguishes among goals, indicators, targets, trends, driving forces, and policy responses. We also highlight the need for continued research on scale, aggregation, critical limits, and thresholds.},

Indicators have long been used to detect changes in nature, but the scientific maturation in indicator development primarily has occurred in the past 40 years. Currently, indicators are mainly used to assess the condition of the environment, as early-warning signals of ecological problems, and as barometers for trends in ecological resources. Use of ecological indicators requires clearly stated objectives; the recognition of spatial and temporal scales; assessments of statistical variability, precision, and accuracy; linkages with specific stressors; and coupling with economic and social indicators. Legislatively mandated use of ecological indicators occurs in many countries worldwide and is included in international accords. As scientific advancements and innovation in the development and use of ecological indicators continue through applications of molecular biology, computer technology such as geographic information systems, data management such as bioinformatics, and remote sensing, our ability to apply ecological indicators to detect signals of environmental change will be substantially enhanced.},

	abstract = {The goal of this research is to provide high resolution local, regional, national and global estimates of annual mangrove forest area from 2000 through to 2012. To achieve this we synthesize the Global Forest Change database, the Terrestrial Ecosystems of the World database, and the Mangrove Forests of the World database to extract mangrove forest cover at high spatial and temporal resolutions. We then use the new database to monitor mangrove cover at the global, national and protected area scales. Countries showing relatively high amounts of mangrove loss include Myanmar, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Guatemala. Indonesia remains by far the largest mangrove-holding nation, containing between 26 percent and 29 percent of the global mangrove inventory with a deforestation rate of between 0.26 percent and 0.66 percent annually. Global mangrove deforestation continues but at a much reduced rate of between 0.16 percent and 0.39 percent annually. Southeast Asia is a region of concern with mangrove deforestation rates between 3.58 percent and 8.08 percent during the analysis period, this in a region containing half of the entire global mangrove forest inventory. The global mangrove deforestation pattern from 2000 to 2012 is one of decreasing rates of deforestation, with many nations essentially stable, with the exception of the largest mangrove-holding region of Southeast Asia. We provide a standardized global spatial dataset that monitors mangrove deforestation globally at high spatiotemporal resolutions, covering 99 percent of all mangrove forests. These data can be used to drive the mangrove research agenda particularly as it pertains to improved monitoring of mangrove carbon stocks and the establishment of baseline local mangrove forest inventories required for payment for ecosystem service initiatives.},

	abstract = {We examine the carbon balance of North American wetlands by reviewing and synthesizing the published literature and soil databases. North American wetlands contain about 220 Pg C, most of which is in peat. They are a small to moderate carbon sink of about 49 Tg C yr−1, although the uncertainty around this estimate is greater than 100\%, with the largest unknown being the role of carbon sequestration by sedimentation in freshwater mineral-soil wetlands. We estimate that North American wetlands emit 9 Tg methane ({CH}4) yr−1; however, the uncertainty of this estimate is also greater than 100\%. With the exception of estuarine wetlands, {CH}4 emissions from wetlands may largely offset any positive benefits of carbon sequestration in soils and plants in terms of climate forcing. Historically, the destruction of wetlands through land-use changes has had the largest effects on the carbon fluxes and consequent radiative forcing of North American wetlands. The primary effects have been a reduction in their ability to sequester carbon (a small to moderate increase in radiative forcing), oxidation of their soil carbon reserves upon drainage (a small increase in radiative forcing), and reduction in {CH}4 emissions (a small to large decrease in radiative forcing). It is uncertain how global changes will affect the carbon pools and fluxes of North American wetlands. We will not be able to predict accurately the role of wetlands as potential positive or negative feedbacks to anthropogenic global change without knowing the integrative effects of changes in temperature, precipitation, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, and atmospheric deposition of nitrogen and sulfur on the carbon balance of North American wetlands.},

	abstract = {Aim  Coral reefs are widely considered to be particularly vulnerable to changes in ocean temperatures, yet we understand little about the broad-scale spatio-temporal patterns that may cause coral mortality from bleaching and disease. Our study aimed to characterize these ocean temperature patterns at biologically relevant scales. Location  Global, with a focus on coral reefs. Methods  We created a 4-km resolution, 21-year global ocean temperature anomaly (deviations from long-term means) database to quantify the spatial and temporal characteristics of temperature anomalies related to both coral bleaching and disease. Then we tested how patterns varied in several key metrics of disturbance severity, including anomaly frequency, magnitude, duration and size. Results  Our analyses found both global variation in temperature anomalies and fine-grained spatial variability in the frequency, duration and magnitude of temperature anomalies. However, we discovered that even during major climatic events with strong spatial signatures, like the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, areas that had high numbers of anomalies varied between years. In addition, we found that 48\% of bleaching-related anomalies and 44\% of disease-related anomalies were less than 50 km2, much smaller than the resolution of most models used to forecast climate changes. Main conclusions  The fine-scale variability in temperature anomalies has several key implications for understanding spatial patterns in coral bleaching- and disease-related anomalies as well as for designing protected areas to conserve coral reefs in a changing climate. Spatial heterogeneity in temperature anomalies suggests that certain reefs could be targeted for protection because they exhibit differences in thermal stress. However, temporal variability in anomalies could complicate efforts to protect reefs, because high anomalies in one year are not necessarily predictive of future patterns of stress. Together, our results suggest that temperature anomalies related to coral bleaching and disease are likely to be highly heterogeneous and could produce more localized impacts of climate change.},

The aggregate indicators are based on several hundred individual underlying variables, taken from a wide variety of existing data sources. The data reflect the views on governance of survey respondents and public, private, and {NGO} sector experts worldwide. The {WGI} also explicitly report margins of error accompanying each country estimate. These reflect the inherent difficulties in measuring governance using any kind of data.

These rises will almost certainly accelerate through the 21st century and beyond because of global warming, but their magnitude remains uncertain. Key uncertainties include the possible role of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets and the amplitude of regional changes in sea level. In many areas, nonclimatic components of relative sea-level change (mainly subsidence) can also be locally appreciable. Although the impacts of sea-level rise are potentially large, the application and success of adaptation are large uncertainties that require more assessment and consideration.},

	shorttitle = {Regions of rapid sea ice change},
	abstract = {This bi-polar analysis resolves ice edge changes on space/time scales relevant for investigating seasonal ice-ocean feedbacks and focuses on spatio-temporal changes in the timing of annual sea ice retreat and advance over 1979/80 to 2010/11. Where Arctic sea ice decrease is fastest, the sea ice retreat is now nearly 2 months earlier and subsequent advance more than 1 month later (compared to 1979/80), resulting in a 3-month longer summer ice-free season. In the Antarctic Peninsula and Bellingshausen Sea region, sea ice retreat is more than 1 month earlier and advance 2 months later, resulting in a more than 3-month longer summer ice-free season. In contrast, in the western Ross Sea (Antarctica) region, sea ice retreat and advance are more than 1 month later and earlier respectively, resulting in a more than 2 month shorter summer ice-free season. Regardless of trend magnitude or direction, and at latitudes mostly poleward of 70° (N/S), there is strong correspondence between anomalies in the timings of sea ice retreat and subsequent advance, but little correspondence between advance and subsequent retreat. These results support a strong ocean thermal feedback in autumn in response to changes in spring sea ice retreat. Further, model calculations suggest different net ocean heat changes in the Arctic versus Antarctic where autumn sea ice advance is 1 versus 2 months later. Ocean-atmosphere changes, particularly in boreal spring and austral autumn (i.e., during ∼March-May), are discussed and compared, as well as possible inter-hemispheric climate connections.},

	abstract = {Several studies have documented fish populations changing in response to long-term warming. Over the past decade, sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Maine increased faster than 99\% of the global ocean. The warming, which was related to a northward shift in the Gulf Stream and to changes in the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation, led to reduced recruitment and increased mortality in the region’s Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) stock. Failure to recognize the impact of warming on cod contributed to overfishing. Recovery of this fishery depends on sound management, but the size of the stock depends on future temperature conditions. The experience in the Gulf of Maine highlights the need to incorporate environmental factors into resource management.
Double jeopardy
In the best of worlds, exploited fish stocks are monitored so that harvest quotas protect the reproductive ability of the population. Climate change is likely to complicate this process substantially. Pershing et al. found that cod stocks declined continuously during intense warming in the North Atlantic. Fisheries quotas, even though they were responsibly set and followed by fishers, decreased the reproductive rate. Thus, managing fisheries in a warming world is going to be increasingly problematic.

	abstract = {Above {pH} 8.5, pepsinogen is converted into a form which cannot be activated to pepsin on exposure to low {pH}. Intermediate exposure to neutral {pH}, however, returns the protein to a form which can be activated. Evidence is presented for a reversible, small conformational change in the molecule, distinct from the unfolding of the protein. At the same time, the molecule is converted to a form of limited solubility, which is precipitated at low {pH}, where activation is normally seen. The results are interpreted in terms of the peculiar structure of the pepsinogen molecule. Titration of the basic {NH}2-terminal region produced an open form, which can return to the native form at neutral {pH}, but which is maintained at low {pH} by neutralization of carboxylate groups in the pepsin portion.},

	abstract = {In the presence of the first recorded red tide (Ptychodiscus brevis) outbreak in North Carolina, autumn 1987 recruitment of bay scallops (Argopecten irradians concentricus) in the state’s most productive scallop beds was a virtual failure. Recruitment averaged across all of Bogue and Back sounds was only 2\% of the mean of three previous red tide-free (control) years. Only from central Core Sound northward, where the red tide occurred later and not as intensively, was bay scallop recruitment normal (93\% of control years). Mortality of adult scallops from early December 1987 to late January 1988, while red tide was at bloom concentrations but fishing was prohibited, was 21\%. No comparable natural mortality data exist for control years because intense fishing mortality in this period is confounded with natural mortality. Data on abundance of articulated pairs of empty shells strongly suggest that the red tide caused mortality of both adult and newly recruited bay scallops. Bay scallop recruitment in autumn 1988 again failed to restock the traditionally productive scallop beds in western Bogue Sound and in Back Sound, perhaps because the only concentrations of spawners surviving the red tide in central Core Sound and further north were too far distant for successful transport of bay scallop larvae in sufficient abundance to these traditional beds. This potential explanation implies continuing impact of the red tide on North Carolina’s bay scallop fishery until spawning populations increase in Back Sound and western Bogue Sound.},

This work contains the results of a study performed with these three compounds, in order to demonstrate their neuropsycholeptic activity in comparison with chloropromazine ({CPZ}) and chlordiazepoxide ({CPD}). The inhibition of motility observed in mice shows that the compounds reduce the normal spontaneous motility as well as the muscle tone. The central-depressant activity is evidenced by increased barbiturate-induced sleep and a remarkable eyelid ptosis can also be observed. Our compounds do not show any activity on electroshock just as do {CPZ} and {CPD}. As to the antipsychotic outline, our compounds show strong reduction of lethality due to amphetamine in grouped mice and a strong antiapomorphine activity. They show also an antiaggressive effect and an inhibitory activity on avoidance behaviour much stronger than {CPZ}. We have also found extrapyramidal effects, as catalepsy, common to many tranquillizers of the kind of the standards used by us. As for vegetative phenomena, the compounds show hypotensive dose related action ranging from moderate to strong, probably due to an a-receptor inhibition. Adrenolytic activity against lethal doses of adrenaline, antiserotonin and antihistaminic effects, as well as other actions (hypothermia, analgesia, etc.) confirm that {RMI} 61 140, {RMI} 61 144 and {RMI} 61 280 are endowed with pharmacologic properties similar and more potent than those of {CPZ}. Studies on the metabolism of brain catecholamines show that they are similar to {CPZ}, although with less effect on dopamine level.},

In response, ecological indicators have been developed to assess the state of reef fisheries and their broader ecosystem-level impacts. To date, use of fisheries indicators for coral reefs has been rather piecemeal, with no overarching understanding of their performance with respect to highlighting fishing effects. Here, we provide a review of multispecies fishery-independent indicators used to evaluate fishing impacts on coral reefs. We investigate the consistency with which indicators highlight fishing effects on coral reefs. We then address questions of statistical power and uncertainty, type of fishing gradient, scale of analysis, the influence of other variables and the need for more work to set reference points for empirical, fisheries-independent indicators on coral reefs. Our review provides knowledge that will help underpin the assessment of the ecological effects of fishing, offering essential support for the development and implementation of coral reef fisheries management plans.},

At this dose level it is less effective than 100 mg of pentobarbital as a sleep inducer. Studies at higher doses (up to 4 mg) indicate that lorazepam has a wide therapeutic index.},

Although there was a 9.8\% increase in the 2,3 {DPG} content following exercise, there was a concomitant 9.4\% increase in the hemoglobin level; therefore, when 2,3 {DPG} is expressed as a ratio to hemoglobin (See Article), there was no significant change as a result of exercise stress. It was suggested that three additive factors produced during strenuous exercise; decreased {pH}; increased hemoglobin concentration; and increased {CO}2 production result in by-product inhibition of 2,3 {DPG} synthesis. It is concluded that 2,3 {DPG} does not provide a physiologic benefit in the adaptation of the oxygen transport system to exercise.},

	abstract = {A neurogenic beta-adrenergic vasodilatation in skeletal muscle has been indicated by some recent investigations. The present study describes the extent to which this neurogenic beta-dilator mechanism contributes to the integrated vascular response in consecutive sections of the muscle vascular bed during sympathetic nerve activation. This was done by studying the vascular reactions to graded sympathetic stimulation (1-16 Hz) before and after beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Beta-blockade did not influence significantly the sympathetically induced changes of total muscle vascular resistance or capacitance. Vascular tone in the "micro-vessels" during stimulation was, however, clearly more pronounced in the beta-blocked than in the non-blocked region, as revealed by segmental resistance analysis and by determination of precapillary sphincter tone ({CFC}). In addition, beta-blockade markedly reduced the net transcapillary absorption of extravascular fluid evoked by nerve activation. This effect could be ascribed to the mentioned influence on the precapillary sphincters, leading to a decrease of the number of capillaries available for transcapillary exchange, and to a limitation of the nerve induced fall of capillary hydrostatic pressure. The described effects of alpha-blockade were observed at all rates of sympathetic stimulation.--The conclusion was reached that the beta-adrenergic dilator component of the sympathetic vascular response in skeletal muscle significantly modifies the alpha-adrenergic constriction in the micro-vessels. It is suggested that, in the intact organism, this neurogenic beta-dilator mechanism is primarily aimed at improving the transcapillary exchange.},

This database provides a unique view of the broad patterns of the biogeographical and ecoclimatic diversity of the global land surface, and presents a detailed interpretation of the extent of human development. The project was carried out as an International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme, Data and Information Systems ({IGBP}-{DIS}) initiative. The {IGBP} {DISCover} global land cover product is an integral component of the global land cover database. {DISCover} includes 17 general land cover classes defined to meet the needs of {IGBP} core science projects. A formal accuracy assessment of the {DISCover} data layer will be completed in 1998. The 1 km global land cover database was developed through a continent-by-continent unsupervised classification of 1 km monthly Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer ({AVHRR}) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ({NDVI}) composites covering 1992-1993. Extensive post-classification stratification was necessary to resolve spectral/temporal confusion between disparate land cover types. The complete global database consists of 961 seasonal land cover regions that capture patterns of land cover, seasonality and relative primary productivity. The seasonal land cover regions were aggregated to produce seven separate land cover data sets used for global environmental modelling and assessment. The data sets include {IGBP} {DISCover}, U.S. Geological Survey Anderson System, Simple Biosphere Model, Simple Biosphere Model 2, Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme, Olson Ecosystems and Running Global Remote Sensing Land Cover. The database also includes all digital sources that were used in the classification. The complete database can be sourced from the website: http://edcwww.cr.usgs.gov/landdaac/glcc/glcc.html.},

Considerable progress has been made in determining the amount and location of plastic debris in our seas, but how much plastic actually enters them in the first place is more uncertain. Jambeck et al. combine available data on solid waste with a model that uses population density and economic status to estimate the amount of land-based plastic waste entering the ocean. Unless waste management practices are improved, the flux of plastics to the oceans could increase by an order of magnitude within the next decade.
Science, this issue p. 768
Plastic debris in the marine environment is widely documented, but the quantity of plastic entering the ocean from waste generated on land is unknown. By linking worldwide data on solid waste, population density, and economic status, we estimated the mass of land-based plastic waste entering the ocean. We calculate that 275 million metric tons ({MT}) of plastic waste was generated in 192 coastal countries in 2010, with 4.8 to 12.7 million {MT} entering the ocean. Population size and the quality of waste management systems largely determine which countries contribute the greatest mass of uncaptured waste available to become plastic marine debris. Without waste management infrastructure improvements, the cumulative quantity of plastic waste available to enter the ocean from land is predicted to increase by an order of magnitude by 2025.
Millions of tons of plastic waste end up in our oceans every year.

	abstract = {Climate warming does not force sea-level rise ({SLR}) at the same rate everywhere. Rather, there are spatial variations of {SLR} superimposed on a global average rise. These variations are forced by dynamic processes, arising from circulation and variations in temperature and/or salinity, and by static equilibrium processes, arising from mass redistributions changing gravity and the Earth’s rotation and shape. These sea-level variations form unique spatial patterns, yet there are very few observations verifying predicted patterns or fingerprints. Here, we present evidence of recently accelerated {SLR} in a unique 1,000-km-long hotspot on the highly populated North American Atlantic coast north of Cape Hatteras and show that it is consistent with a modelled fingerprint of dynamic {SLR}. Between 1950–1979 and 1980–2009, {SLR} rate increases in this northeast hotspot were {\textasciitilde} 3–4 times higher than the global average. Modelled dynamic plus steric {SLR} by 2100 at New York City ranges with Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenario from 36 to 51 cm (ref. 3); lower emission scenarios project 24–36 cm (ref. 7). Extrapolations from data herein range from 20 to 29 cm. {SLR} superimposed on storm surge, wave run-up and set-up will increase the vulnerability of coastal cities to flooding, and beaches and wetlands to deterioration.},

	shorttitle = {Threatened protection},
	abstract = {Federal, state, and local governments in the United States, along with land trusts and other nonprofit organizations, have invested significant financial resources in protection of natural lands in coastal areas. As the climate changes, protected lands could provide increased resilience to coastal communities, yet climate change also poses a threat to the continued existence and healthy functioning of these ecosystems. The objectives of this research are to characterize the distribution and types of coastal protected lands in the eastern United States, estimate their exposure to sea level rise, evaluate the potential impact of this exposure on associated ecosystem services, and then discuss appropriate adaptation measures. For this, we construct an inventory of coastal protected lands in shoreline counties of {US} states along the Atlantic. We summarize their ownership and land cover and evaluate their exposure to a 3-foot (0.91 m) rise in sea level. We find substantial variation in the amount of lands protected in coastal shoreline counties, from a high of 34 percent in Florida to a low of 7 percent in Pennsylvania. Federal ownership is greatest in the South, whereas state ownership dominates in the Mid-Atlantic. Private groups own large shares of protected lands in Maine, New Hampshire, Delaware, and Maryland. Moving south, dominant land covers in protected areas shift from forests to wetlands. We find that one quarter of protected lands in shoreline counties will be affected by 3 feet of sea level rise, with substantial heterogeneity in exposure across states and greater impacts in southern states. Almost 50 percent of federal lands and around 25 percent of state lands will be affected. While substantial proportions of estuarine wetlands and unconsolidated shore (beaches and dunes) are currently protected and provide key coastal ecosystem services, 95 and 91 percent of these protected systems, respectively, will be affected by 3 feet of sea level rise. We discuss the potential consequences and the associated reductions in ecosystem service provisioning from sea level rise in the context of current funding and adaptation planning for conservation. We find that some of the states facing the greatest challenges are those lacking plans and funding. The large heterogeneity in ownership, land covers, and funding across states suggests that adaptation policies for coastal protected lands will need to be tailored to the local context; a one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to be as effective.},

	abstract = {Data from 4,713 fisheries worldwide, representing 78\% of global reported fish catch, are analyzed to estimate the status, trends, and benefits of alternative approaches to recovering depleted fisheries. For each fishery, we estimate current biological status and forecast the impacts of contrasting management regimes on catch, profit, and biomass of fish in the sea. We estimate unique recovery targets and trajectories for each fishery, calculate the year-by-year effects of alternative recovery approaches, and model how alternative institutional reforms affect recovery outcomes. Current status is highly heterogeneous—the median fishery is in poor health (overfished, with further overfishing occurring), although 32\% of fisheries are in good biological, although not necessarily economic, condition. Our business-as-usual scenario projects further divergence and continued collapse for many of the world’s fisheries. Applying sound management reforms to global fisheries in our dataset could generate annual increases exceeding 16 million metric tons ({MMT}) in catch, \$53 billion in profit, and 619 {MMT} in biomass relative to business as usual. We also find that, with appropriate reforms, recovery can happen quickly, with the median fishery taking under 10 y to reach recovery targets. Our results show that commonsense reforms to fishery management would dramatically improve overall fish abundance while increasing food security and profits.},

	shorttitle = {Still catching attention},
	abstract = {In 2005, the Sea Around Us described a website (www.seaaroundus.org) which presented, for all maritime countries and large marine ecosystems in the world, one of the most basic information items required by policy makers and fisheries managers: what catch was taken within their jurisdictional boundaries, and which countries took it. Surprisingly, for many countries this kind of jurisdictionally and/or ecologically assigned data had not been readily available before then. Since the release of these spatialized data, this material has had major influence on how fisheries are perceived by policy makers in various countries and by the global scientific community, as well as by a growing list of other stakeholders such as non-governmental environmental organizations and the general public. Here, the Sea Around Us updates the fisheries science, policy, conservation and management audience on the extensively modified spatial allocation method and a substantially improved new website. Also, this contribution points to and describes the much improved catch data underlying this website. These data now account for catches for all countries in the world by fisheries sectors (industrial, artisanal, subsistence, recreational), after augmenting the officially reported landings data through the inclusion of comprehensively reconstructed data of previously unreported catches and major discards, for every maritime country or territory in the world, and their Exclusive Economic Zone ({EEZ}). Also presented are the extensively improved spatial allocation procedures which assign global catch data to the 180,000 half degree spatial cells used by the Sea Around Us to subdivide the global ocean. The reconstructed data for 1950–2010 for all countries in the world and the High Seas, freely accessible and downloadable through the Sea Around Us web portal, will be updated regularly. It is hoped that these revised data and the substantially improved web utility will invigorate and assist the debate about the role of fisheries in a global framework as well as in national food security settings.},

	abstract = {Composite indicators ({CIs}) are increasingly used to measure and track environmental systems. However, they have faced criticism for not accounting for uncertainties and their often arbitrary nature. This review highlights methodological challenges and uncertainties involved in creating {CIs} and provides advice on how to improve future {CI} development in practice. Linguistic and epistemic uncertainties enter {CIs} at different stages of development and may be amplified or reduced based on subjective decisions during construction. Lack of transparency about why decisions were made can risk impeding proper review and iterative development. Research on uncertainty in {CIs} currently focuses on how different construction decisions affect the overall results and is explored using sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. Much less attention is given to uncertainties arising from the theoretical framework underpinning the {CI}, and the sub-indicator selection process. This often lacks systematic rigour, repeatability and clarity. We recommend use of systems modelling as well as systematic elicitation and engagement during {CI} development in order to address these issues. Composite indicators make trends in complex environmental systems accessible to wider stakeholder groups, including policy makers. Without proper discussion and exposure of uncertainty, however, they risk misleading their users through false certainty or misleading interpretations. This review offers guidance for future environmental {CI} construction and users of existing {CIs}, hence supporting their iterative development and effective use in policy-making.},

	abstract = {Sharing of research data has begun to gain traction in many areas of the sciences in the past few years because of changing expectations from the scientific community, funding agencies, and academic journals. National Science Foundation ({NSF}) requirements for a data management plan ({DMP}) went into effect in 2011, with the intent of facilitating the dissemination and sharing of research results. Many projects that were funded during 2011 and 2012 should now have implemented the elements of the data management plans required for their grant proposals. In this paper we define ‘data sharing’ and present a protocol for assessing whether data have been shared and how effective the sharing was. We then evaluate the data sharing practices of researchers funded by the {NSF} at Oregon State University in two ways: by attempting to discover project-level research data using the associated {DMP} as a starting point, and by examining data sharing associated with journal articles that acknowledge {NSF} support. Sharing at both the project level and the journal article level was not carried out in the majority of cases, and when sharing was accomplished, the shared data were often of questionable usability due to access, documentation, and formatting issues. We close the article by offering recommendations for how data producers, journal publishers, data repositories, and funding agencies can facilitate the process of sharing data in a meaningful way.},

The era of big data need not be propelled only by “big science” – the term used to describe large-scale efforts that have had mixed success in the individual-driven culture of ecology. Collectively, ecologists already have big data to bolster the scientific effort – a large volume of distributed, high-value information – but many simply fail to contribute. We encourage ecologists to join the larger scientific community in global initiatives to address major scientific and societal problems by bringing their distributed data to the table and harnessing its collective power. The scientists who contribute such information will be at the forefront of socially relevant science – but will they be ecologists?},

One of the central goals in any scientific endeavor is to understand causality. Experiments that seek to demonstrate a cause/effect relation most often manipulate the postulated causal factor. Aarts et al. describe the replication of 100 experiments reported in papers published in 2008 in three high-ranking psychology journals. Assessing whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study.
Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aac4716
Structured Abstract
{INTRODUCTIONReproducibility} is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error.
{RATIONALEThere} is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science.
{RESULTSWe} conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (Mr = 0.197, {SD} = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (Mr = 0.403, {SD} = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P {\textless} .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.
{CONCLUSIONNo} single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here.Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that “we already know this” belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/349/6251/aac4716/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Original study effect size versus replication effect size (correlation coefficients).Diagonal line represents replication effect size equal to original effect size.

We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. Replication effects were half the magnitude of original effects, representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had statistically significant results. Thirty-six percent of replications had statistically significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.
A large-scale assessment suggests that experimental reproducibility in psychology leaves a lot to be desired.

The topics in this article include an introduction to the grammar by working through the process of creating a plot, and discussing the components that we need. The grammar is then presented formally and compared to Wilkinson’s grammar, highlighting the hierarchy of defaults, and the implications of embedding a graphical grammar into a programming language. The power of the grammar is illustrated with a selection of examples that explore different components and their interactions, in more detail. The article concludes by discussing some perceptual issues, and thinking about how we can build on the grammar to learn how to create graphical “poems.” Supplemental materials are available online.},

Here we describe observations obtained on a cruise in the summer of 2012 and compare them with results from a cruise following a similar track in 2007. The focus is on describing spatial patterns of aragonite saturation state (ΩAr). This parameter is an indicator of ecosystem health, in particular for calcifying organisms. The results show large-scale regional trends from different source waters at the northeastern and southwestern edges of the domain, along with the modulating effects of remineralization/respiration and riverine inputs. The broader patterns and changes over five years along the coast can be well described by the impacts of large-scale circulation, notably changes in source water contributions. Changes in the well-buffered Loop Current and Gulf Stream with high ΩAr impact the waters in the southern part of the study area. The less buffered southward coastal currents with low ΩAr originating from the Labrador Sea and Gulf of St. Lawrence impact the ΩAr patterns in the Northern regions. The expected 2\% average decrease in ΩAr in the surface mixed layer due to increasing atmospheric {CO}2 levels over the 5-year period is largely overshadowed by local and regional variability from changes in hydrography and mixed layer dynamics.},

	abstract = {A holistic methodological procedure to assess estuarine vulnerability within a spatio-temporal framework is presented. This approach quantifies the vulnerability of estuaries to point-source pollution considering the physical processes, the ecological features, and the social aspects related to the existing estuarine ecosystem services. Estuarine vulnerability is referred to those characteristics of an estuarine ecosystem that describe its potential to be harmed. Thus, vulnerability is presented as a combination of four parameters: Tidal Zoning ({TZ}), State of Conservation ({SC}), Susceptibility ({SU}), and Stratification ({ST}). {TZ} differs between intertidal and subtidal zones. {SC} is determined as a combination of Naturalness ({NA}) and Ecological Value ({EV}). {NA} is defined as the absence of physical anthropogenic modifications, and {EV} is described as the presence of singular flora and fauna. While {SU} is related to the flushing or cleaning capacity, {ST} accounts for the location of mixed, partially mixed/stratified and stratified areas in the estuary. Subsequently, categories, thresholds and assessment criteria for every parameter, and a composite index to integrate all of them, namely the Estuarine Vulnerability Index ({EVI}), are presented. {EVI} has been applied to the Suances Estuary (N Spain) to find out the optimal locations for hypothetical point discharges. The results obtained for the Suances Estuary confirm the suitability of the proposed methodology and its conceptual approach as a comprehensive and practical management tool to quantify and prioritize estuarine areas receiving point-source pollution.},

	abstract = {Management of marine ecosystems increasingly demands comprehensive and quantitative assessments of ocean health, but lacks a tool to do so. We applied the recently developed Ocean Health Index to assess ocean health in the relatively data-rich {US} west coast region. The overall region scored 71 out of 100, with sub-regions scoring from 65 (Washington) to 74 (Oregon). Highest scoring goals included tourism and recreation (99) and clean waters (87), while the lowest scoring goals were sense of place (48) and artisanal fishing opportunities (57). Surprisingly, even in this well-studied area data limitations precluded robust assessments of past trends in overall ocean health. Nonetheless, retrospective calculation of current status showed that many goals have declined, by up to 20\%. In contrast, near-term future scores were on average 6\% greater than current status across all goals and sub-regions. Application of hypothetical but realistic management scenarios illustrate how the Index can be used to predict and understand the tradeoffs among goals and consequences for overall ocean health. We illustrate and discuss how this index can be used to vet underlying assumptions and decisions with local stakeholders and decision-makers so that scores reflect regional knowledge, priorities and values. We also highlight the importance of ongoing and future monitoring that will provide robust data relevant to ocean health assessment.},

	abstract = {Biological reference point ({BRP}) is one of the essential components in the management strategy evaluation that is used to determine the status of fishery stock and set management regulations. However, as {BRPs} can be derived from different models and many different {BRPs} are available, the effectiveness and consistency of different {BRPs} should be evaluated before being applied to fisheries management. In this study, we used a computation-intensive approach to identify optimal {BRPs}. We systematically evaluated 1500 combinations of alternative {BRPs} in managing the bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) fisheries in the Indian Ocean. The effectiveness and consistency of these {BRPs} were evaluated using four performance measures related to fisheries landing performance and biomass conservation. Monte Carlo simulation was used to evaluate various uncertainties. The results suggest that the proposed computation-intensive approach can be effective in identifying optimal {BRPs} with respect to a set of defined performance measures. We found that the current maximum sustainable yield ({MSY})-based {BRP} combinations are effective target {BRPs} to manage the bigeye and yellowfin tuna fisheries with the “linear” harvest control rule ({HCR}). However, using the “knife-edge” {HCR}, better {BRPs} could be found for both the bigeye and yellowfin tuna fisheries management with improved fisheries and conservation performance. The framework developed in this study can be used to identify suitable {BRPs} based on a set of defined performance measures for other fisheries.},

More than 60\% of 6136 surface plankton net tows collected buoyant plastic pieces, typically millimeters in size. The highest concentration of plastic debris was observed in subtropical latitudes and associated with the observed large-scale convergence in surface currents predicted by Ekman dynamics. Despite a rapid increase in plastic production and disposal during this time period, no trend in plastic concentration was observed in the region of highest accumulation.

	title = {An Analysis of Gulf of Maine Cod Metapopulation Structure and Localized Stability, with Application to Area-Based Fisheries Management},
	url = {http://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/etd/2582},
	abstract = {The complex metapopulation structure of groundfish stocks in the Gulf of Maine, particularly Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), is largely ignored under the current system of broad-scale stock assessment and management. This mismatch of biological and administrative scales has contributed to severe overall stock decline and localized serial depletion of Gulf of Maine cod. Such chronic management failure has led to growing calls for a more area-based, finer-scale approach to managing groundfish in the Gulf of Maine. A primary difficulty hindering the development of finer-scale groundfish management has been the challenge of estimating fishing mortality upon local stock components. However, generic system dynamics models may permit early identification of stock components being pushed toward instability by excessive fishing pressure. Interpolation of existing fishery-independent survey data within approximate subpopulation boundaries permits the construction of estimated abundance indices for metapopulation components. This study utilizes a model-based approach to classify these indices into risk categories based on the likelihood that they may be trending toward more unstable dynamics. Such an approach offers a potential solution to the problems of limited data and logistical impracticality that prevent the use of analytical assessment models at finer spatial scales.},

	abstract = {Fighting for Fisheries
In the debate concerning the future of the world's fisheries, some have forecasted complete collapse but others have challenged this view. The protagonists in this debate have now joined forces to present a thorough quantitative review of current trends in world fisheries. Worm et al. (p. 578) evaluate the evidence for a global rebuilding of marine capture fisheries and their supporting ecosystems. Contrasting regions that have been managed for rebuilding with those that have not, reveals trajectories of decline and recovery from individual stocks to species, communities, and large marine ecosystems. The management solutions that have been most successful for rebuilding fisheries and ecosystems, include both large- and small-scale fisheries around the world.
After a long history of overexploitation, increasing efforts to restore marine ecosystems and rebuild fisheries are under way. Here, we analyze current trends from a fisheries and conservation perspective. In 5 of 10 well-studied ecosystems, the average exploitation rate has recently declined and is now at or below the rate predicted to achieve maximum sustainable yield for seven systems. Yet 63\% of assessed fish stocks worldwide still require rebuilding, and even lower exploitation rates are needed to reverse the collapse of vulnerable species. Combined fisheries and conservation objectives can be achieved by merging diverse management actions, including catch restrictions, gear modification, and closed areas, depending on local context. Impacts of international fleets and the lack of alternatives to fishing complicate prospects for rebuilding fisheries in many poorer regions, highlighting the need for a global perspective on rebuilding marine resources.
Catch restrictions, gear modification, and closed areas are helping to rebuild overexploited marine ecosystems.

We developed a global database of management and fish population data (433 and 218 {MPAs}, respectively) to assess: {MPA} management processes; the effects of {MPAs} on fish populations; and relationships between management processes and ecological effects. Here we report that many {MPAs} failed to meet thresholds for effective and equitable management processes, with widespread shortfalls in staff and financial resources. Although 71\% of {MPAs} positively influenced fish populations, these conservation impacts were highly variable. Staff and budget capacity were the strongest predictors of conservation impact: {MPAs} with adequate staff capacity had ecological effects 2.9 times greater than {MPAs} with inadequate capacity. Thus, continued global expansion of {MPAs} without adequate investment in human and financial capacity is likely to lead to sub-optimal conservation outcomes.},

There is mounting concern over the impact that future {CO}2-induced reductions in the {CaCO}3 saturation state of seawater will have on marine organisms that construct their shells and skeletons from this mineral. Here, we present the results of 60 d laboratory experiments in which we investigated the effects of {CO}2-induced ocean acidification on calcification in 18 benthic marine organisms. Species were selected to span a broad taxonomic range (crustacea, cnidaria, echinoidea, rhodophyta, chlorophyta, gastropoda, bivalvia, annelida) and included organisms producing aragonite, low-Mg calcite, and high-Mg calcite forms of {CaCO}3. We show that 10 of the 18 species studied exhibited reduced rates of net calcification and, in some cases, net dissolution under elevated {pCO}2. However, in seven species, net calcification increased under the intermediate and/or highest levels of {pCO}2, and one species showed no response at all. These varied responses may reflect differences amongst organisms in their ability to regulate {pH} at the site of calcification, in the extent to which their outer shell layer is protected by an organic covering, in the solubility of their shell or skeletal mineral, and in the extent to which they utilize photosynthesis. Whatever the specific mechanism(s) involved, our results suggest that the impact of elevated atmospheric {pCO}2 on marine calcification is more varied than previously thought.},

The uncertainties in our knowledge and the difficulty in resolving them satisfactorily can be challenging, given that we are confined to working with largely observational data because experiments at scale are difficult or impossible. To advance this area of research, we suggest applying a conceptual framework that allows us to break the components into smaller parts that can integrate uncertainty and connect variables of interest to outcomes of interest. We identify four specific questions inherent to a risk framework: the first three focus on risk analysis, and the fourth on risk management or mitigation. We present examples that are both data rich and data poor and discuss the value of integrating a systems perspective, connecting sources and drivers to dynamics and distribution to impacts and management responses. We also propose applying risk analysis to the plastics pollution issue as we acknowledge and embrace uncertainty, noting the precautionary principle and its application to risk management.},

	abstract = {The benefits provided by a healthy ocean are receiving increasing attention in policy and management spheres. A fundamental challenge with assessing ocean health and ecosystem services is that we lack a scientific framework for expressing ecosystem conditions quantitatively in relation to management goals. Here we outline and operationalize a conceptual framework for identifying meaningful reference points and quantifying the current ecosystem state relative to them. The framework requires clear articulation of management goals and is built on a review of current scientific understanding and assessment of data availability. It develops a structured approach for choosing among three classes of reference points, including: (1) functional relationships that establish the ocean state that can be produced and sustained under different environmental conditions, (2) time series approaches that compare current to previous capacities to obtain a particular ocean state in a specific location, and (3) spatial reference points that compare current capacities to achieve a desired ocean state across regional (or, if necessary, global) scales. We illustrate this general framework through the lens of ocean health defined in terms of a coupled social-ecological system, with examples from fisheries, marine livelihoods, and water quality in the {USA}. Assessment of ocean health and ecosystem services can be significantly influenced by the choice of indicators used to track changes in a management goal, the type of reference point selected, and how one measures the distance of the current state from the reference point. This framework provides flexible, standardized methods for evaluating ocean health and ecosystem services that can advance important components of ecosystem-based management, including marine spatial planning, ecosystem service valuation, and integrated ecosystem assessments.},

Seagrass meadows, a prominent feature of most healthy coastal ecosystems, are often also associated with shallow coral reefs. Many plants have bioremediation qualities, and seagrasses, of which there are 60 or so species, produce natural biocides. Lamb et al. found that the seagrass meadows of inhabited atolls near Sulawesi, Indonesia, ameliorated seawater pollution from human-origination bacteria. This effect extended to potential pathogens of marine invertebrates and fish: Reefs fringing the seagrass meadows showed significantly less impact from coral and fish disease.
Science, this issue p. 731
Plants are important in urban environments for removing pathogens and improving water quality. Seagrass meadows are the most widespread coastal ecosystem on the planet. Although these plants are known to be associated with natural biocide production, they have not been evaluated for their ability to remove microbiological contamination. Using amplicon sequencing of the 16S ribosomal {RNA} gene, we found that when seagrass meadows are present, there was a 50\% reduction in the relative abundance of potential bacterial pathogens capable of causing disease in humans and marine organisms. Moreover, field surveys of more than 8000 reef-building corals located adjacent to seagrass meadows showed twofold reductions in disease levels compared to corals at paired sites without adjacent seagrass meadows. These results highlight the importance of seagrass ecosystems to the health of humans and other organisms.

Dozens of expeditions measuring microplastics have been carried out since the 1970s, but they have primarily focused on the North Atlantic and North Pacific accumulation zones, with much sparser coverage elsewhere. Here, we use the largest dataset of microplastic measurements assembled to date to assess the confidence we can have in global estimates of microplastic abundance and mass. We use a rigorous statistical framework to standardize a global dataset of plastic marine debris measured using surface-trawling plankton nets and coupled this with three different ocean circulation models to spatially interpolate the observations. Our estimates show that the accumulated number of microplastic particles in 2014 ranges from 15 to 51 trillion particles, weighing between 93 and 236 thousand metric tons, which is only approximately 1\% of global plastic waste estimated to enter the ocean in the year 2010. These estimates are larger than previous global estimates, but vary widely because the scarcity of data in most of the world ocean, differences in model formulations, and fundamental knowledge gaps in the sources, transformations and fates of microplastics in the ocean.},

It is difficult to predict how these regulations will influence angler participation and recreational fishing mortality. This research integrates a utility-theory consistent model of demand for recreational fishing trips with an age-structured stock dynamics model to provide policy relevant advice to managers of the groundfish fishery in the Northeast United States. The recreational cod and haddock regulations implemented in 2014 have high costs in terms of foregone angler welfare and minimal positive impacts on stock conditions after three years. The ability of policies that generate large amounts of discarding, like high minimum size limits, to meet conservation objectives are also found to be quite sensitive to assumptions about the recreational discard mortality rate.},

	abstract = {Climate change vulnerability assessments have been receiving increasing attention from policymakers and academics. Given scarce funds for adaptation, the {UNFCCC} Secretariat has suggested that eligible countries be prioritized for support based on their vulnerability to climate change. National-level fisheries sector climate change vulnerability assessments as well as other overall vulnerability assessments to date have lent support to the idea that least developed countries ({LDCs}) are more vulnerable to climate change than small island developing states ({SIDS}) and other coastal countries. We demonstrate that these perceived differences in vulnerability among country groups are partly due to methodological choices made during these assessments. We argue that national-level vulnerability assessments, and particularly those dealing with the fisheries sector, often suffer from four main methodological shortcomings: (i) an inconsistent representation of countries belonging to each group, (ii) use of socioeconomic indicators that are not scaled to population size, (iii) use of a small number of indicators and (iv) lack of accounting for potential redundancy among indicators. Building on a previous framework, we show that by addressing the four aforementioned methodological shortcomings, the ranking in fisheries sector vulnerability among {SIDS}, {LDCs} and other coastal countries is altered significantly. Our results underscore that the vulnerability of {SIDS} was partially concealed in previous assessments and suggest that {SIDS} are in fact the most vulnerable group. Although this study focuses on assessing the vulnerability of the fisheries sector to climate change in {SIDS}, {LDCs} and other coastal countries, the implications also apply to other sectors and country groupings.},

However, stock depletion is extremely difficult to estimate, particularly with limited data. Using the {RAM} Legacy database, we developed a boosted regression tree ({BRT}) model to correlate depletion with a range of predictors calculated from catch data, making the model usable for many fisheries worldwide. The most important predictors were found to be catch trends obtained from linear regressions of scaled catch on time, including regression coefficients for the whole catch time series, the subseries before and after the maximum catch, and in recent years. Eight predictors explain about 80\% of variation in depletion. There is a correlation of .5 between measured levels of depletion and the predictions of the {BRT} model. Predictions are less biased when the stock is fished down below half of the carrying capacity. The {BRT} model outperforms comparable existing catch-based depletion estimators and could be used to provide priors for depletion for data-poor stock assessment methods, or used more directly to provide estimates of the probability that depletion is below a given threshold value.},

Reference points derived from models are compared with direct use of data series, and a broad-brush approach providing a redundancy of indicators is recommended.

	abstract = {Anthropogenic debris contaminates marine habitats globally, leading to several perceived ecological impacts. Here, we critically and systematically review the literature regarding impacts of debris from several scientific fields to understand the weight of evidence regarding the ecological impacts of marine debris. We quantified perceived and demonstrated impacts across several levels of biological organization that make up the ecosystem and found 366 perceived threats of debris across all levels. Two hundred and ninety-six of these perceived threats were tested, 83\% of which were demonstrated. The majority (82\%) of demonstrated impacts were due to plastic, relative to other materials (e.g., metals, glass) and largely (89\%) at suborganismal levels (e.g., molecular, cellular, tissue). The remaining impacts, demonstrated at higher levels of organization (i.e., death to individual organisms, changes in assemblages), were largely due to plastic marine debris ({\textgreater}1 mm; e.g., rope, straws, and fragments). Thus, we show evidence of ecological impacts from marine debris, but conclude that the quantity and quality of research requires improvement to allow the risk of ecological impacts of marine debris to be determined with precision. Still, our systematic review suggests that sufficient evidence exists for decision makers to begin to mitigate problematic plastic debris now, to avoid risk of irreversible harm.},

In response, concerns about risks to marine wildlife upon exposure to the varied forms of plastic debris have increased, stimulating new research into the extent and consequences of plastics contamination in the marine environment. Here, I present a framework to evaluate the current understanding of the sources, distribution, fate, and impacts of marine plastics. Despite remaining knowledge gaps in mass budgeting and challenges in investigating ecological impacts, the increasing evidence of the ubiquity of plastics contamination in the marine environment, the continued rapid growth in plastics production, and the evidence—albeit limited—of demonstrated impacts to marine wildlife support immediate implementation of source-reducing measures to decrease the potential risks of plastics in the marine ecosystem.},

Management strategy evaluation ({MSE}) is a tool that has been widely used to develop and test single species fisheries management strategies and is now being extended to support ecosystem based fisheries management ({EBFM}). We describe the application of {MSE} to investigate alternative strategies for achieving {EBFM} goals for a complex multispecies fishery in southeastern Australia. The study was undertaken as part of a stakeholder driven process to review and improve the ecological, economic and social performance of the fishery. An integrated management strategy, involving combinations of measures including quotas, gear controls and spatial management, performed best against a wide range of objectives and this strategy was subsequently adopted in the fishery, leading to marked improvements in performance. Although particular to one fishery, the conclusion that an integrated package of measures outperforms single focus measures we argue is likely to apply widely in fisheries that aim to achieve {EBFM} goals.},

To facilitate new analyses, we developed a new database, the {RAM} Legacy Stock Assessment Database, for commercially exploited marine fishes and invertebrates. Time series of total biomass, spawner biomass, recruits, fishing mortality and catch/landings form the core of the database. Assessments were assembled from 21 national and international management agencies for a total of 331 stocks (295 fish stocks representing 46 families and 36 invertebrate stocks representing 12 families), including nine of the world’s 10 largest fisheries. Stock assessments were available from 27 large marine ecosystems, the Caspian Sea and four High Seas regions, and include the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Arctic and Antarctic Oceans. Most assessments came from the {USA}, Europe, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. Assessed marine stocks represent a small proportion of harvested fish taxa (16\%), and an even smaller proportion of marine fish biodiversity (1\%), but provide high-quality data for intensively studied stocks. The database provides new insight into the status of exploited populations: 58\% of stocks with reference points (n = 214) were estimated to be below the biomass resulting in maximum sustainable yield ({BMSY}) and 30\% had exploitation levels above the exploitation rate resulting in maximum sustainable yield ({UMSY}). We anticipate that the database will facilitate new research in population dynamics and fishery management, and we encourage further data contributions from stock assessment scientists.},

	abstract = {The ‘Only Reliable Catch Stocks’ ({ORCS}) Working Group approach to data-poor fisheries stock status and catch limit estimation has been used by U.S. fisheries managers but has yet to be fully evaluated. The {ORCS} approach estimates stock status using a fourteen question ‘Table of Attributes’ and the overfishing limit by multiplying a historical catch statistic by a scalar based on the estimated status. We evaluated the performance of the approach by applying it to 193 stocks with data-rich stock assessments and comparing its predictions of stock status with the assessment model estimates. The approach classified all but three stocks as fully exploited indicating that it is a poor predictor of status and should not be used by managers. We refined the original {ORCS} approach by: (1) developing a more predictive model of stock status using boosted classification trees and (2) identifying the historical catch statistics and scalars that best estimate overfishing limits using assessment model data. The refined {ORCS} approach correctly classified 74\% of all stocks and 62\% of overexploited stocks in a training dataset and 74\% of all stocks and 50\% of overexploited stocks in an independent test dataset. The refined approach performed better than six other widely used catch-only methods. However, the overfishing limits estimated by the refined approach would further deplete overexploited stocks without the use of conservative catch scalars to buffer against classification uncertainty. Conservative catch scalars can reduce the probability of overfishing below 50\%, the U.S. legal maximum, but with concomitant increases in the probability and magnitude of underfishing. The refined {ORCS} approach may therefore be useful when other methods are not possible or appropriate and some risk of underfishing is acceptable.},

	abstract = {This paper examines how the requirement for annual catch limits ({ACLs}) has been implemented for data-limited stocks in all federally-managed fisheries in the United States. The legal mandate to establish {ACLs} in the U.S. has spurred substantial scientific advances, including the development and adoption of at least 16 methods for establishing catch limits for data-limited fisheries. This study analyzed the assessment methods that form the basis of {ACLs}, those which determine the overfishing limits ({OFLs}) and the acceptable biological catches ({ABCs}). Nationally, 30\% (150) of {OFLs}/{ABCs} are currently calculated using conventional data-rich assessment methods, 11\% (59) using data-moderate methods, and 59\% (295) using data-poor approaches. There is substantial variation in the proportion of stocks that are currently managed with data-rich versus data-limited methods across regions, and there are clear geographical patterns in the types and diversity of methods being utilized to calculate {OFLs}/{ABCs}. Data-poor methods are the most commonly used {OFL}/{ABC}-setting methods in the U.S., particularly in the Southeast, Atlantic highly migratory species ({HMS}), Pacific, and Western Pacific regions. The Southeast and Atlantic {HMS} regions use some form of catch scalar or an {ABC} of zero landings for each data-limited stock. The Pacific and North Pacific regions currently employ a higher diversity of data-limited methods than any other region; these include both data-moderate methods and data-poor methods. Regional disparities in data-limited method development and implementation are attributed to regional differences in the number of stocks being managed, the data types and lengths of the time series available, and the resources dedicated to data processing and stock assessment. Recommendations for improving management of data-limited stocks include establishing a complete inventory of all available data for each managed stock, dedicating resources and expertise to data-limited method development and evaluation, and developing a more streamlined assessment process to handle the expanded volume of stocks requiring {ACLs}.},

While the 178 stocks above 80\% of {BMSY} are conventionally considered “fully exploited,” stocks staying at this level for many years, forego substantial yield. Our results enable managers to consider more detailed information than simply a categorization of stocks as “fully” or “over” exploited. Our approach is reproducible, allows consistent application to a broad range of stocks, and can be easily updated as new data become available. Applied on an ongoing basis, this approach can provide critical, more detailed information for resource management for more exploited fish stocks than currently available.},

This omission limits the validity of their findings and may undermine the ‘science-based’ decisions they inform. We summarize and analyze seven commonly perceived challenges to conducting uncertainty assessment that help explain why it often receives superficial treatment in {ES} studies. We connect these challenges to solutions in relevant scientific literature and guidance documents. Since {ES} science is based on a multiplicity of disciplines (e.g. ecology, hydrology, economics, environmental modeling, policy sciences), substantial knowledge already exists to identify, quantify, and communicate uncertainties. The integration of these disciplines for solution-oriented modeling has been the focus of the integrated assessment community for many years, and we argue that many insights and best practices from this field can be directly used to improve {ES} assessments. We also recognize a number of issues that hinder the adoption of uncertainty assessment as part of standard practice. Our synthesis provides a starting point for {ES} analysts and other applied modelers looking for further guidance on uncertainty assessment and helps scientists and decision-makers to set reasonable expectations for characterizing the level of confidence associated with an {ES} assessment.},

Global patterns for fisheries are positively related to human development and latitude, whereas patterns for mariculture are most closely associated with economic importance of seafood. Sensitivity analyses show that scores are robust to several model assumptions, but highly sensitive to choice of reference points and, for fisheries, extent of time series available to estimate landings.

	abstract = {* 1Ecologists use statistical models for both explanation and prediction, and need techniques that are flexible enough to express typical features of their data, such as nonlinearities and interactions.
* 2This study provides a working guide to boosted regression trees ({BRT}), an ensemble method for fitting statistical models that differs fundamentally from conventional techniques that aim to fit a single parsimonious model. Boosted regression trees combine the strengths of two algorithms: regression trees (models that relate a response to their predictors by recursive binary splits) and boosting (an adaptive method for combining many simple models to give improved predictive performance). The final {BRT} model can be understood as an additive regression model in which individual terms are simple trees, fitted in a forward, stagewise fashion.
* 3Boosted regression trees incorporate important advantages of tree-based methods, handling different types of predictor variables and accommodating missing data. They have no need for prior data transformation or elimination of outliers, can fit complex nonlinear relationships, and automatically handle interaction effects between predictors. Fitting multiple trees in {BRT} overcomes the biggest drawback of single tree models: their relatively poor predictive performance. Although {BRT} models are complex, they can be summarized in ways that give powerful ecological insight, and their predictive performance is superior to most traditional modelling methods.
* 4The unique features of {BRT} raise a number of practical issues in model fitting. We demonstrate the practicalities and advantages of using {BRT} through a distributional analysis of the short-finned eel (Anguilla australis Richardson), a native freshwater fish of New Zealand. We use a data set of over 13 000 sites to illustrate effects of several settings, and then fit and interpret a model using a subset of the data. We provide code and a tutorial to enable the wider use of {BRT} by ecologists.},

To fully understand these patterns, it is necessary to identify where the benefits accumulate, how balanced the arrangements are, and how the pattern is evolving over time. Here the flow of global seafood was traced from locations of capture or production to their countries of consumption using novel approaches and databases. Results indicate an increasing dominance of Asian fleets by the volume of catch from the 1950s to the 2010s, including fishing in the high seas. The majority of landings were by high-income countries’ fishing fleets in their own waters in the 1950s but this pattern was greatly altered by the 2010s, with more equality in landings volume and value by fleets representing different income levels. Results also show that the higher the income of a country, the more valuable seafood it imports compared to its exports and vice versa. In theory, this implies that the lower income countries are exporting high value seafood in part to achieve the broader goal of ending poverty, while achieving the food security goal by retaining and importing lower value seafood. In the context of access arrangements between developed and developing countries, the results allow insights into the consequences of these shifting sources of income may have for goals such as poverty reduction and food security.},

This poses a challenge for the sustainable management of these stocks. Recent requirements to set scientifically based catch limits in several countries, and growing consumer demand for sustainably managed fish have spurred an emerging field of methods for estimating overfishing thresholds and setting catch limits for stocks with limited data. Using a management strategy evaluation framework we quantified the performance of a number of data-limited methods. For most life-histories, we found that methods that made use of only historical catches often performed worse than maintaining current fishing levels. Only those methods that dynamically accounted for changes in abundance and/or depletion performed well at low stock sizes. Stock assessments that make use of historical catch and effort data did not necessarily out-perform simpler data-limited methods that made use of fewer data. There is a high value of additional information regarding stock depletion, historical fishing effort and current abundance when only catch data are available. We discuss the implications of our results for other data-limited methods and identify future research priorities.},

	abstract = {Fishery managers must often reconcile conflicting estimates of population status and trend. Superensemble models, commonly used in climate and weather forecasting, may provide an effective solution. This approach uses predictions from multiple models as covariates in an additional “superensemble” model fitted to known data. We evaluated the potential for ensemble averages and superensemble models (ensemble methods) to improve estimates of population status and trend for fisheries. We fit four widely applicable data-limited models that estimate stock biomass relative to equilibrium biomass at maximum sustainable yield (B/{BMSY}). We combined these estimates of recent fishery status and trends in B/{BMSY} with four ensemble methods: an ensemble average and three superensembles (a linear model, a random forest and a boosted regression tree). We trained our superensembles on 5,760 simulated stocks and tested them with cross-validation and against a global database of 249 stock assessments. Ensemble methods substantially improved estimates of population status and trend. Random forest and boosted regression trees performed the best at estimating population status: inaccuracy (median absolute proportional error) decreased from 0.42 – 0.56 to 0.32 – 0.33, rank-order correlation between predicted and true status improved from 0.02 – 0.32 to 0.44 – 0.48 and bias (median proportional error) declined from −0.22 – 0.31 to −0.12 – 0.03. We found similar improvements when predicting trend and when applying the simulation-trained superensembles to catch data for global fish stocks. Superensembles can optimally leverage multiple model predictions; however, they must be tested, formed from a diverse set of accurate models and built on a data set representative of the populations to which they are applied.},

	abstract = {Indicators are needed to support the implementation of an ecosystem approach to fisheries ({EAF}), by providing information on the state of the ecosystem, the extent and intensity of effort or mortality and the progress of management in relation to objectives. Here, I review recent work on the development, selection and application of indicators and consider how indicators might support an {EAF}. Indicators should guide the management of fishing activities that have led to, or are most likely to lead to, unsustainable impacts on ecosystem components or attributes. The numbers and types of indicators used to support an {EAF} will vary among management regions, depending on resources available for monitoring and enforcement, and actual and potential fishing impacts. State indicators provide feedback on the state of ecosystem components or attributes and the extent to which management objectives, which usually relate to state, are met. State can only be managed if the relationships with fishing (pressure) and management (response) are known. Predicting such relationships is fundamental to developing a management system that supports the achievement of objectives. In a management framework supported by pressure, state and response indicators, the relationship between the value of an indicator and a target or limit reference point, reference trajectory or direction provides guidance on the management action to take. Values of pressure, state and response indicators may be affected by measurement, process, model and estimation error and thus different indicators, and the same indicators measured at different scales and in different ways, will detect true trends on different timescales. Managers can use several methods to estimate the effects of error on the probability of detecting true trends and/or to account for error when setting reference points, trajectories and directions. Given the high noise to signal ratio in many state indicators, pressure and response indicators would often guide short-term management decision making more effectively, with state indicators providing longer-term policy-focused feedback on the effects of management action.},

The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them.

Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise.

General lack of data and uncertainty about the level of employment in marine fisheries can lead to underestimation of fishing effort and hence over-exploited fisheries, or result in inaccurate projections of economic and societal costs and benefits. To address this gap, a database of marine fisheries employment for 144 coastal nations was compiled. Gaps in employment data that emerged were filled using a Monte Carlo approach to estimate the number of direct and indirect fisheries jobs. We focused on estimating jobs in the small-scale fishing sector. We characterized small-scale fishing as (i) primarily geared towards household consumption or sale at the local level; (ii) conducted at a low level of economic activity; (iii) minimally mechanized; (iv) conducted within inshore areas; (v) minimally managed; and/or (vi) undertaken for cultural or ceremonial purposes. In total, we estimated that 260 ± 6 million people are involved in global marine fisheries, encompassing full-time and part-time jobs in the direct and indirect sectors, with 22 ± 0.45 million of those being small-scale fishers. This is equivalent to 203 ± 34 million full-time equivalent jobs. Study results can be used to improve management decision making and highlight the need to improve monitoring and reporting of the number of people employed in marine fisheries globally.},

	abstract = {Forage fish support the largest fisheries in the world but also play key roles in marine food webs by transferring energy from plankton to upper trophic-level predators, such as large fish, seabirds, and marine mammals. Fishing can, thereby, have far reaching consequences on marine food webs unless safeguards are in place to avoid depleting forage fish to dangerously low levels, where dependent predators are most vulnerable. However, disentangling the contributions of fishing vs. natural processes on population dynamics has been difficult because of the sensitivity of these stocks to environmental conditions. Here, we overcome this difficulty by collating population time series for forage fish populations that account for nearly two-thirds of global catch of forage fish to identify the fingerprint of fisheries on their population dynamics. Forage fish population collapses shared a set of common and unique characteristics: high fishing pressure for several years before collapse, a sharp drop in natural population productivity, and a lagged response to reduce fishing pressure. Lagged response to natural productivity declines can sharply amplify the magnitude of naturally occurring population fluctuations. Finally, we show that the magnitude and frequency of collapses are greater than expected from natural productivity characteristics and therefore, likely attributed to fishing. The durations of collapses, however, were not different from those expected based on natural productivity shifts. A risk-based management scheme that reduces fishing when populations become scarce would protect forage fish and their predators from collapse with little effect on long-term average catches.},

	abstract = {Increased recognition of the need for ecosystem-based management has resulted in a growing body of research on the use of indicators to represent and track ecosystem status, particularly in marine environments. While multiple frameworks have been developed for selecting and evaluating indicators, certain types of indicators require additional consideration and validation. In particular, an index, which we define as an aggregation of two or more indicators, may have unique properties and behaviors that can make interpretation difficult, particularly in a management context. We assert that more rigorous validation and testing is required for indices, particularly those used to inform management decisions. To support this point we demonstrate the need for validation and then explore current development and validation processes for ecosystem indices. We also compare how other disciplines (e.g., medicine, economics) validate indices. Validating indices (and indicators) is particularly challenging because they are often developed without an explicit objective in mind. We suggest that exploring the sensitivity of an index to the assumptions made during its development be a pre-requisite to employing such an index.},

This chapter uses the idea of ‘sense of place’ to explore the material and perceptual relations that emerge as a result of marine fishing in a range of villages and towns in France and England along the English Channel. Currently sense of place is an underused concept in resource management in general and within fisheries management in particular. We show how sense of place can be used to make visible a range of social and cultural values that emerge from the process of marine fishing. These values can then be expressed within a cultural ecosystem services framework, potentially helping to make the results accessible to a broader range of stakeholders, including policy makers and those involved in developing sustainable communities. The chapter concludes with some thoughts about the usefulness of approaches like actor network theory in providing relational perspectives for understanding marine fisheries management.},

To achieve this, efficient decision support integrates the results of pre-existing models. Many environmental models are deterministic, but the uncertainty of their outcomes needs to be estimated when they are utilized for decision support. We review various methods that have been or could be applied to evaluate the uncertainty related to deterministic models' outputs. We cover expert judgement, model emulation, sensitivity analysis, temporal and spatial variability in the model outputs, the use of multiple models, and statistical approaches, and evaluate when these methods are appropriate and what must be taken into account when utilizing them. The best way to evaluate the uncertainty depends on the definitions of the source models and the amount and quality of information available to the modeller.},

	abstract = {Ecosystems can show sudden and persistent changes in state despite only incremental changes in drivers. Such critical transitions are difficult to predict, because the state of the system often shows little change before the transition. Early-warning indicators ({EWIs}) are hypothesized to signal the loss of system resilience and have been shown to precede critical transitions in theoretical models, paleo-climate time series, and in laboratory as well as whole lake experiments. The generalizability of {EWIs} for detecting critical transitions in empirical time series of natural aquatic ecosystems remains largely untested, however. Here we assessed four commonly used {EWIs} on long-term datasets of five freshwater ecosystems that have experienced sudden, persistent transitions and for which the relevant ecological mechanisms and drivers are well understood. These case studies were categorized by three mechanisms that can generate critical transitions between alternative states: competition, trophic cascade, and intraguild predation. Although {EWIs} could be detected in most of the case studies, agreement among the four indicators was low. In some cases, {EWIs} were detected considerably ahead of the transition. Nonetheless, our results show that at present, {EWIs} do not provide reliable and consistent signals of impending critical transitions despite using some of the best routinely monitored freshwater ecosystems. Our analysis strongly suggests that a priori knowledge of the underlying mechanisms driving ecosystem transitions is necessary to identify relevant state variables for successfully monitoring {EWIs}.},

	abstract = {Coastal habitats provide important benefits to people, including habitat for species targeted by fisheries and opportunities for tourism and recreation. Yet, such human activities also can imperil these habitats and undermine the ecosystem services they provide to people. Cumulative risk assessment provides an analytical framework for synthesizing the influence of multiple stressors across habitats and decision-support for balancing human uses and ecosystem health. To explore cumulative risk to habitats in the U.S. Northeast and Mid-Atlantic Ocean Planning regions, we apply the open-source {InVEST} Habitat Risk Assessment model to 13 habitats and 31 stressors in an exposure-consequence framework. In doing so, we advance the science priorities of {EBM} and both regional planning bodies by synthesizing the wealth of available data to improve our understanding of human uses and how they affect marine resources. We find that risk to ecosystems is greatest first, along the coast, where a large number of stressors occur in close proximity and secondly, along the continental shelf, where fewer, higher consequence activities occur. Habitats at greatest risk include soft and hard-bottom nearshore areas, tidal flats, soft-bottom shelf habitat, and rocky intertidal zones—with the degree of risk varying spatially. Across all habitats, our results indicate that rising sea surface temperatures, commercial fishing, and shipping consistently and disproportionally contribute to risk. Further, our findings suggest that management in the nearshore will require simultaneously addressing the temporal and spatial overlap as well as intensity of multiple human activities and that management in the offshore requires more targeted efforts to reduce exposure from specific threats. We offer a transparent, generalizable approach to evaluating cumulative risk to multiple habitats and illustrate the spatially heterogeneous nature of impacts along the eastern Atlantic coast and the importance of spatial scale in estimating such impacts. These results offer a valuable decision-support tool by helping to constrain the decision space, focus attention on habitats and locations at the greatest risk, and highlight effect management strategies.},

Looking towards 2050, the question is how fisheries governance, and the national and international policy and legal frameworks within which it is nested, will ensure a sustainable harvest, maintain biodiversity and ecosystem functions, and adapt to climate change. This paper looks at global fisheries production, the state of resources, contribution to food security and governance.

	abstract = {Introduction:Human impacts on Arctic marine ecosystems are increasing in extent and intensity as sea ice shrinks and utilization of marine resources expands. The effects of climate change are being felt across the arctic while stressors such as commercial fishing and shipping continue to grow as the Arctic becomes more accessible. Given these emerging changes, there is need for an assessment of the current cumulative impact of human activities to better anticipate and manage for a changing Arctic. Cumulative human impacts ({CHI}) assessments have been widely applied around the world in a variety of ecosystem types but have yet to incorporate temporal dynamics of individual stressors. Such dynamics are fundamental to Arctic ecosystems.Outcomes:Here, we present the first {CHI} assessment of an Arctic ecosystem to incorporate sea ice as a habitat and assess impact seasonality, using the Bering Strait Region ({BSR}) as a case study. We find that cumulative impacts differ seasonally, with lower impacts in winter and higher impacts in summer months. Large portions of the {BSR} have significantly different impacts within each season when compared to a mean annual cumulative impact map. Cumulative impacts also have great spatial variability, with Russian waters between 2.38 and 3.63 times as impacted as {US} waters.Conclusion:This assessment of seasonal and spatial cumulative impacts provides an understanding of the current reality in the {BSR} and can be used to support development and evaluation of future management scenarios that address expected impacts from climate change and increasing interest in the Arctic.},

The large number of economic, social, and environmental indicators currently available provides an unwieldy view of system sustainability. To aid policy decisions, these indicators are therefore either presented in the context of a conceptual framework, or quantitatively aggregated into indices. Due to the quantitative nature of sustainability indices, their results may be given more weight by scientists and policy-makers. However, policy decisions can be ineffective or even counterproductive if they do not consider factors which influence index behavior: the scale of the available data and choice of system boundaries; the inclusion, transformation, and weighting of indicator data; and the aggregation method used. As previous reviews have demonstrated, sustainability indices do not rank countries consistently, even when using some of the same indicator data. Several improvements would increase the utility of sustainability indices for policy decisions, particularly the identification of biases introduced by the index methodology and data inclusion. The discrepancy of current sustainability indices due to theoretical or methodological differences supports the use of several complementary indices.},

Based on available data at local and regional levels, we estimate a total global yearly seafood consumption of 2.1 million (1.5 million–2.8 million) metric tonnes by coastal Indigenous peoples, equal to around 2\% of global yearly commercial fisheries catch. Results reflect the crucial role of seafood for these communities; on average, consumption per capita is 15 times higher than non-Indigenous country populations. These findings contribute to an urgently needed sense of scale to coastal Indigenous issues, and will hopefully prompt increased recognition and directed research regarding the marine knowledge and resource needs of Indigenous peoples.

	abstract = {We have produced annual estimates of national and global gas flaring and gas flaring efficiency from 1994 through 2008 using low light imaging data acquired by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program ({DMSP}). Gas flaring is a widely used practice for the disposal of associated gas in oil production and processing facilities where there is insufficient infrastructure for utilization of the gas (primarily methane). Improved utilization of the gas is key to reducing global carbon emissions to the atmosphere. The {DMSP} estimates of flared gas volume are based on a calibration developed with a pooled set of reported national gas flaring volumes and data from individual flares. Flaring efficiency was calculated as the volume of flared gas per barrel of crude oil produced. Global gas flaring has remained largely stable over the past fifteen years, in the range of 140 to 170 billion cubic meters ({BCM}). Global flaring efficiency was in the seven to eight cubic meters per barrel from 1994 to 2005 and declined to 5.6 m3 per barrel by 2008. The 2008 gas flaring estimate of 139 {BCM} represents 21\% of the natural gas consumption of the {USA} with a potential retail market value of \$68 billion. The 2008 flaring added more than 278 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent ({CO}2e) into the atmosphere. The {DMSP} estimated gas flaring volumes indicate that global gas flaring has declined by 19\% since 2005, led by gas flaring reductions in Russia and Nigeria, the two countries with the highest gas flaring levels. The flaring efficiency of both Russia and Nigeria improved from 2005 to 2008, suggesting that the reductions in gas flaring are likely the result of either improved utilization of the gas, reinjection, or direct venting of gas into the atmosphere, although the effect of uncertainties in the satellite data cannot be ruled out. It is anticipated that the capability to estimate gas flaring volumes based on satellite data will spur improved utilization of gas that was simply burnt as waste in previous years.},

	abstract = {Understanding global fisheries patterns contributes significantly to their management. By combining harmonized unmapped data sources with maps from satellite tracking data, regional tuna management organisations, the ranges of fished taxa, the access of fleets and the logistics of associated fishing gears the expansion and intensification of marine fisheries for nearly a century and half (1869–2015) is illustrated. Estimates of industrial, non-industrial reported, illegal/unreported ({IUU}) and discards reveal changes in country dominance, catch composition and fishing gear use. Catch of industrial and non-industrial marine fishing by year, fishing country, taxa and gear by 30-min spatial cell broken to reported, {IUU} and discards is available. Results show a historical increase in bottom trawl with corresponding reduction in the landings from seines. Though diverse, global landings are now dominated by demersal and small pelagic species.},

The archive of seven altimeter missions has been processed to create a two decade database of ship locations. The estimated annual density maps compare well with the ones obtained from Automatic Identiﬁcation System. The ship traﬃc analysis shows a global fourfold growth between 1992 and 2012, the largest increase being observed in the Indian Ocean and the Chinese seas reﬂecting the world trade change. Although mainly concentrated along lanes, the traﬃc has a direct impact on the atmosphere, e.g., on the growth of tropospheric nitrogen dioxide in the Indian Ocean.},
