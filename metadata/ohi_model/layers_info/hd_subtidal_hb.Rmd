Reefs at Risk Revisited (Burke et al. 2007) recorded the global presence of destructive artisanal blast fishing based on survey observations and expert opinion. We reclassified the log-scale scoring system for the blast rasters, so 0 = 0, 100 = 1, 1000 = 2. The mean raster score was then determined for each OHI region. The blast values for each region were then summed to get the total.
