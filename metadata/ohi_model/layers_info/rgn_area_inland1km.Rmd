See **`r layer_meta$name[layer_meta$layer == 'rgn_area']`** layer for more information.

Area (km^2^) located from each region's land-sea interface to 1 km inland. 

For coastal land areas, we extracted hi-resolution country boundary data from ESRI (2010), and rasterized it with a resolution to match our land-sea interface model. We grew this raster by 50 pixels to bridge gaps between the ESRI data and our land-sea model. Area values do not include inland lakes or EEZs.
