The OHI Fellows Program is our new approach to calculating global scores annually. The OHI team trains Fellows in cutting-edge open data science tools that they then apply while conducting the annual global assessment.

The OHI Fellows Program not only produces annual global OHI scores, these highly trained graduate students become valuable members to the global OHI community. We have run the program in 2018, 2019, and 2020 with a fantastic group of students.

Communication was a big part of the Fellowship experience: 

- The Fellows created and maintain the [globalfellows website](http://ohi-science.org/globalfellows) and [blogged](http://ohi-science.org/globalfellows/blog.html) as they learned
- They also gave an excellent [presentation about their work](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OHsnnspXKT5f1szxinzB5rh2grejNBSoxxrE0dOwino/edit?usp=sharing) at the NCEAS Roundtable
- Ellie made a website for our [`ohicore` R package](http://ohi-science.org/ohicore)
- Iwen made an [interactive data explorer](https://iwensu.shinyapps.io/global-dashboard/) for the Mariculture goal
- Camila created country score cards and produced our [training videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpe7jmt0-J4&list=PLX7J3qtjcll_4s2oaKHuWdRdBMJz7tBAU)
- Sara and Maddie created comprehensive methods documents for the [Palmyra](https://ohi-4site.github.io/pal-scores/documents/methods-results/Supplement.html) and [Tetiaroa](https://ohi-4site.github.io/tet-scores/documents/methods-results/Supplement.html) assessments. 

Additionally, we [blogged](http://ohi-science.org/news) about the experience:
