The OHI Fellows Program is our new approach to calculating global scores annually. The OHI team trains Fellows in cutting-edge open data science tools that they then apply while conducting the annual global assessment.

The OHI Fellows Program not only produces annual global OHI scores, these highly trained graduate students become valuable members to the global OHI community. We have run the program in 2018 and 2019 with a fantastic group of students and will continue that tradition with the third cohort in 2020.

Communication was a big part of the Fellowship experience: 

- The Fellows created and maintain the [globalfellows website](http://ohi-science.org/globalfellows) and [blogged](http://ohi-science.org/globalfellows/blog.html) as they learned
- They also gave an excellent [presentation about their work](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OHsnnspXKT5f1szxinzB5rh2grejNBSoxxrE0dOwino/edit?usp=sharing) at the NCEAS Roundtable
- Ellie made a website for our [`ohicore` R package](http://ohi-science.org/ohicore)
- Iwen made an [interactive data explorer](https://iwensu.shinyapps.io/global-dashboard/) for the Mariculture goal
- Camila created country score cards and produced our [training videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpe7jmt0-J4&list=PLX7J3qtjcll_4s2oaKHuWdRdBMJz7tBAU)
