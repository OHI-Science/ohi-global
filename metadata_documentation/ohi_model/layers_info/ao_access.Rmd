This layer represents the opportunity for artisanal and recreational fishing in each country based on the quality of management of the small-scale fishing sector. Global data were extracted from [United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (UN SDG) 14.b.1.](https://sdg.data.gov/14-b-1/) UN SDG 14.b.1 [@sdg_14_b_1]. FAO member country responses to the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (CCRF) (Table 6.1) survey questionnaire which is circulated by FAO every two years to members and IGOs and INGOs and are on a scale from 0 to 1. 

Questions from UN SDG 14.b.1 that were used to evaluate access to artisanal scale fishing:

* Are there any laws, regulations, policies, plans or strategies that specifically target or address the
small-scale fisheries sector?

Does your country have a specific initiative to implement the SSF Guidelines?
