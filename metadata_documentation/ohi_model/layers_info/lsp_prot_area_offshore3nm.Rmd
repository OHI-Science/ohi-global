This includes marine protected areas within 3nm offshore of the coastline.  

Data is from the United Nations Environment Programme - World Conservation Monitoring Centre’s World Database on Protected Areas [-@unep-wcmcandiucn2022]  ([http://www.protectedplanet.net](http://www.protectedplanet.net)). Data includes all nationally designated (e.g., National Parks, Nature Reserves) and internationally recognized protected areas (e.g., UNESCO World Heritage Sites, Ramsar Wetlands of International Importance) as an ESRI shapefile. We used only WDPA polygons (not points) with a status of “designated” (not “proposed”). These polygons were converted to a 500 m Mollweide raster by the value of the year in which the park was decreed “designated”. For cases in which polygons overlapped, priority was given first to the parks with the earliest year. The total amount of protected area (km^2^) was calculated for each year for: the entire eez, 3 nm offshore, and 1km inland (depending on the dimension being calculated).
