Soft bottom subtidal habitat condition was estimated using apparent fishing effort with demersal destructive gear types from Global Fishing Watch [@noauthor_global_2022]. This data includes the apparent hours of trawling and dredging on a global scale at a 0.01 degree resolution. Global Fishing Watch combines all trawling together, so we subset annual trawling raster to just reflect bottom trawling by multiplying the annual trawling rasters by the respective annual rasters for tonnes of fisheries harvest for marine species caught with the same gear types [@watson2019global]. This fisheries harvest data serves as a proxy for the proportion of bottom trawling to mid-water trawling at each location. The annual fisheries catch rasters come with a 0.5 degree resolution and were partially composed of missing values, so it was interpolated and up-sampled to 0.01 degree resolution before it was used to subset the trawling data.

We spatially standardized the fishing effort by soft bottom habitat. We first summed rasters that represent several different types of soft bottom habitat, such as soft shelfs, sediment, and benthic mud. These rasters were sourced from Halpern et al. [-@halpern2015spatial]. We accounted for error in the soft bottom habitat labels by aggregating the cells and deriving a proportion of the soft bottom habitat over that larger area. We multiplied this soft bottom habitat raster by the fishing effort to subset it to just the demersal fishing that occurred on soft bottom habitat, while also maintaining the soft bottom habitat that is undisturbed to assign high scores to regions that are not destructive. The annual destructive fishing effort was assigned to each OHI region by spatially extracting the effort that intersected the regional EEZ polygons.

Because the distribution of fishing effort density values for each region was extremely skewed, we took transformed them by taking the natural log using $log(X+1)$ and then rescaled the values by dividing by the 95th quantile of density across all years and regions. Any rescaled density value greater than 1.0 was capped at 1.0. Condition was then calculated as one minus the rescaled fishing effort density for each year and region.
