Soft bottom subtidal habitat condition was estimated using relative intensity of fishing with demersal destructive gear types. We used global catch data (Watson 2019) that describes the tonnes of harvest for each species and gear type at 0.5 degree raster scale.  To estimate the amount of destructive catch, we multiplied each catch record by a value, ranging from 0-1 (1 being the most destructive), based on how destructive the gear type is to soft bottom habitat (trawl and dredge = 1, gillnet and trap = 0.5, "other" = 0.25, and midwater trawl, pole and line, longline, purse seine and seine = 0).

We summed commercial and non-commercial destructive catch for each OHI region and year, and we divided by the area of soft-bottom habitat in the region. The extent of soft-bottom area within a region was defined as shallow subtidal (0-60m) and outer shelf (60-200m) soft bottom habitat. Because these values were extremely skewed, we $ln(X+1)$ transformed them and then rescaled by dividing by the 95th quantile of density across all years/regions.Condition was then calculated as one minus the rescaled catch density in the most recent year and further rescaled to the median condition value across all years. Any value greater than the median was set = 1.0.
