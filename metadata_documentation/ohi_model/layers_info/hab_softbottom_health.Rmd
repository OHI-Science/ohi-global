Soft bottom subtidal habitat condition was estimated using apparent fishing effort with demersal destructive gear types from Global Fishing Watch, using their API. This data includes the hours of trawling and dredging on a global scale at a 0.01 degree resolution. Global Fishing Watch combines all trawling together, so we subset their trawling raster by multiplying it by the annual raster for tonnes of fisheries harvest for marine species and gear type, which serves as a proxy for the proportion of bottom trawling to mid-water trawling at each location. This raster comes with a 0.5 degree resoltion, and is resampled to up-sample to 0.01 degree resolution.

We summed the destructive fishing effort for each OHI region and year and standardized by dividing by the square kilometers of soft-bottom habitat in the region. The extent of soft-bottom area within a region was defined as shallow subtidal (0-60m) and outer shelf (60-200m) soft bottom habitat. Because these values were extremely skewed, we $ln(X+1)$ transformed them and then rescaled by dividing by the 95th quantile of density across all years and regions. Condition was then calculated as one minus the rescaled fishing effort density in the most recent year and further rescaled to the median condition value across all years. Any value greater than the median was capped at 1.0.
