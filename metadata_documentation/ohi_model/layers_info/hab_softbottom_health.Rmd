Soft bottom subtidal habitat condition was estimated using apparent fishing effort with demersal destructive gear types from Global Fishing Watch [@noauthor_global_2022]. This data includes the apparent hours of trawling and dredging on a global scale at a 0.01 degree resolution. Global Fishing Watch combines all trawling together, so we subset annual trawling raster to just reflect bottom trawling by multiplying the annual trawling rasters by the respective annual raster for tonnes of fisheries harvest for marine species and gear type [@watson2019global]. This fisheries harvest data serves as a proxy for the proportion of bottom trawling to mid-water trawling at each location. The annual fisheries catch rasters come with a 0.5 degree resolution and were partially composed of missing values, so it was interpolated and up-sampled to 0.01 degree resolution before it was used to subset the trawling data.

We summed the destructive fishing effort for each OHI region and year and standardized by dividing by the square kilometers of soft bottom habitat in the region. The extent of soft-bottom area within a region was defined as shallow subtidal (0-60m) and outer shelf (60-200m) soft bottom habitat. This soft bottom raster was sourced from Halpern et al. [-@halpern2008global]. Because the distribution of fishing effort density values for each region was extremely skewed, we $ln(X+1)$ transformed them and then rescaled by dividing by the 95th quantile of density across all years and regions. Any rescaled density value greater than 1.0 was capped at 1.0. Condition was then calculated as one minus the rescaled fishing effort density for each year and region.
