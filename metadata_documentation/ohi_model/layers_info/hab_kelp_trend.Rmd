Trend in kelp condition was determined using "Global patterns of kelp forest change over the past half-century" (Krumhansl et al. 2016). Krumhansl et al. (2016) calculated marine ecoregional kelp trend values using Bayesian hierarchical linear models. We extract these trends per the Marine Ecoregions of the World (MEOW), and a take weighted area mean to get final trends per region represented in the paper. Finally, where country data were not available, we gapfill by the georegional average.
