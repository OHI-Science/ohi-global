Trend in kelp condition was determined using "Global patterns of kelp forest change over the past half-century" [@krumhansl2016global]. Krumhansl et al. [-@krumhansl2016global] calculated marine ecoregional kelp trend values using Bayesian hierarchical linear models. We extract these trends per the Marine Ecoregions of the World (MEOW) [@spalding2007marine], and a take weighted area mean to get final trends per region represented in the paper. Finally, where country data were not available, we gapfill by the georegional average.
