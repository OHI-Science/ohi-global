Ten mariculture practice criteria from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch Aquaculture Recommendations [@2022] contributed to the sustainability of mariculture (data quality, effluent, habitat risk, chemical use, feed, escapes, disease, source of stock, predator and wildlife mortalities, and escape of secondary species). These criteria represent the internal mariculture practices with the potential to affect the long term sustainability of the mariculture system. Scores for each assessment criterion were aggregated and averaged. All country average scores were then rescaled from 0 to 1 using the maximum raw Seafood Watch score and minimum of 0, under the assumption that the highest score is the best possible given current technologies.

These scores are country and species-specific, however, many country/species combinations are not assessed by Seafood Watch.  Given that each mariculture record must have a corresponding sustainability score we used a series of steps to estimate sustainability scores for every country and species.  If a country/species match was available we used that, otherwise, we gapfilled using the following sequence:
1. Used the global species value provided by SeaFood Watch
2. Within a country, used average of species within the same family
3. Within a UN geo-political region, used average of species within the same family
4. Global, use average of species within the same family
5. Global, use average of species within a broad taxonomic grouping (e.g., crustaceans, algae, bivalves, etc.)
6. Finally, if these scores were not available for the categories above, we used the global average of all species. 

Seaweed or algae species were given the global seaweed sustainability score provided by the Seafood Watch recommendations. We are aware that there is some bias associated with using scores derived as averages across countries because they were originally assigned to specific species-country pairs, nevertheless this is preferable to applying a sustainability score solely based on a subset of the species harvested.

Criteria         | Description of practice and score scheme
----------------- | ----------------------------------------
Data     | Poor data quality and availability limits the ability to assess and understand the impacts of aquaculture production. It also does not enable informed choices for seafood purchasers or enable businesses to be held accountable for their impacts. A score between 1 and 10 was given based on data availability, quality, and confidence. 
Effluent    | Aquaculture species, production systems and management methods vary in the amount of waste produced per unit of production. The combined discharge of farms, groups of farms or industries contribute to local and regional nutrient loads. A score of 1 to 10 is given based on the concern of the effluent produced from the practices. 
Habitats   | Aquaculture farms can be located in a wide variety of aquatic and terrestrial habitat types and have greatly varying levels of impact to both pristine and previously modified habitats as well as to the critical “ecosystem services” they provide. Scores are based on whether they are  located at sites, scales and intensities that maintain the functionality of ecologically valuable habitats.
Chemical use | Improper use of chemical treatments impacts non-target organisms and leads to production losses and human health concerns due to the development of chemical-resistant organisms. Scores are based on if facilities limit the type, frequency of use, total use, or discharge of chemicals to levels representing a low risk of impact to non-target organisms. 
Feed | Feed consumption, feed type, ingredients used and the net nutritional gains or losses vary dramatically between farmed species and production systems. Producing feeds and their ingredients has complex global ecological impacts, and the efficiency of conversion can result in net food gains or dramatic net losses of nutrients. Feed use is considered to be one of the defining factors of aquaculture sustainability. Scores are based on whether facilities source sustainable feed ingredients and convert them efficiently with net edible nutrition gains.
Escapes | Competition, altered genetic composition, predation, habitat damage, spawning disruption, and other impacts on wild fish and ecosystems resulting from the escape of native, non-native and/or genetically distinct fish or other unintended species from aquaculture operations. Scores are based on whether facilities prevent population-level impacts to wild species or other ecosystem-level impacts from farm escapes.
Disease, pathogen and parasite interaction | Amplification of local pathogens and parasites on fish farms and their transmission or retransmission to local wild species that share the same water body. Scores are based on whether facilities prevent population-level impacts to wild species through the amplification and retransmission, or increased virulence of pathogens or parasites. 
Source of stock | The removal of fish from wild populations for growing to harvest size in farms. Scores are based on whether facilities use eggs, larvae, or juvenile fish produced from farm-raised broodstocks thereby avoiding the need for wild capture.
Predator and wildlife mortalities | Mortality of predators or other wildlife caused or contributed to by farming operations. Scores are based on whether facilities prevent population-level impacts to predators or other species of wildlife attracted to farm sites. 
Escape of secondary species | Movement of live animals resulting in introduction of unintended species. Scores are based on whether facilities avoid the potential for the accidental introduction of secondary species or pathogens resulting from the shipment of animals.
