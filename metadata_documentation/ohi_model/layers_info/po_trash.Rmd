Marine plastic pollution is modeled using data on the global distribution of floating marine plastics at 0.2 degree resolution [@eriksen2014plastic]. Specifically, weight of floating plastics (g/km^2^) across four different size classes were aggregated to represent total weight of plastic debris per km^2^. These data were log transformed and rescaled from 0 to 1 using the 99.99th quantile as the reference point.
