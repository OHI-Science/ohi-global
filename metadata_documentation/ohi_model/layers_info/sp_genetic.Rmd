This layer represents the potential for harmful genetic escapement based on whether the species being cultured is native or introduced. Data come from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch Aquaculture Recommendations (SFW, 2021). Ten mariculture practice criteria from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch (SFW) Aquaculture Recommendations contributed to the sustainability of mariculture (data quality, effluent, habitat risk, chemical use, feed, escapes, disease, source of stock, predator and wildlife mortalities, and escape of secondary species). The escapes criteria was used for this layer, where a score of 1 is the lowest, and a score of 10 is the highest. The scores reflect the potential impact of genetic escapes on local biodiversity, if these species were to escape. Genetic ‘pollution’ can arise when larvae, spats or seeds escape from poorly managed hatcheries, making native species vulnerable to outbreeding depressions and/or genetic bottlenecks. All country average scores were then rescaled from 0 to 1 using the maximum possible raw SFW score of 10 and minimum of 1.

These scores are country and species-specific, however, many country/species combinations are not assessed by SeaFood Watch.  Given that each mariculture record must have a corresponding escapes score we used a series of steps to estimate escapes scores for every country and species. If a country/species match was available we used that, otherwise, we gapfilled using the following sequence:

1. Used the global species value provided by SeaFood Watch
2. Within a country, used average of species within the same family
3. Within a UN geo-political region, used average of species within the same family
4. Global, use average of species within the same family
5. Global, use average of species within a broad taxonomic grouping (e.g., crustaceans, algae, bivalves, etc.)
6. Finally, if these scores were not available for the categories above, we used the global average of all species. 

Seaweed or algae species were given the global seaweed escapes score provided by the Seafood Watch recommendations. We are aware that there is some bias associated with using scores derived as averages across countries because they were originally assigned to specific species-country pairs, nevertheless this is preferable to applying an escapes score solely based on a subset of the species harvested.
