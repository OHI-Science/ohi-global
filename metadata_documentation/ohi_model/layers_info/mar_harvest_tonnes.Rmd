Mariculture production is calculated from the FAO Global Aquaculture Production Quantity dataset [@unitednations2022a]. Only production classified in the "Marine" and "Brackishwater" environments were included in the analysis (all "Freshwater" production was excluded). If species common names fit into a larger taxonomic group that was present in the existing database, or if another common name for that species was already present, the duplicate names were converted to the name already present in the database. Marine species that are not consumed as food were excluded. Non-edible seaweeds were excluded because they are included in the natural products goal. Seaweeds that are partially consumed as food were weighted with a value between 0 and 1 that represents the proportion of the yield used as food. All species produced within a country were summed to give a single production value for each country in each year that production took place. For the three EEZs that fall within the China region (China, Macau, and Hong Kong), we combined the values by summing across these EEZs.
