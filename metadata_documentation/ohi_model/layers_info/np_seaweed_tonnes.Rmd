Seaweed mariculture production from the FAO Global Aquaculture Production Quantity dataset [@unitednations2022a]. Only production classified in the "Marine" and "Brackishwater" environments was included in the analysis (all "Freshwater" production was excluded). All non edible seaweed species produced within a country were summed to give a single production value for each country in each year that production took place. For the three EEZs that fall within the China region (China, Macau, and Hong Kong), we combined the values by summing across these EEZs.
