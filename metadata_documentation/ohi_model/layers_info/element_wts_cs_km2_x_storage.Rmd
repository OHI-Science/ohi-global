This layer describes the relative value of the habitats in each region to carbon storage, and is calculated by multiplying the habitat extent (km^2^) in each region by the amount of carbon the habitat sequesters [@chen_tidal_2022]. 

Data is generated in ohi-global/eez/conf/functions.R. 

These data are called internally by ohicore functions (see: conf/config.R to see how these data are specified) to weight the data used to calculate pressure and resilience values. 

**Table 7.3. Carbon storage weights**

|Habitat carbon storage| Sequestration (weight)|
|----------------------|-------|
| Mangrove             | 230.9 |
| Saltmarsh            | 244.7 |
| Seagrass             |   138 |
| Tidal flat           | 129.8 |
