This layer describes the relative value of the habitats in each region to carbon storage, and is calculated by multiplying the habitat extent (km^2^) in each region by the amount of carbon the habitat sequesters (Laffoley & Grimsditch 2009). 

Data is generated in ohi-global/eez/conf/functions.R. 

These data are called internally by ohicore functions (see: conf/config.R to see how these data are specified) to weight the data used to calculate pressure and resilience values.

Habitat | Carbon storage
------------- | -------------
Mangrove | 139
Saltmarsh | 210 
Seagrass | 83
