The risk layer is based on whether ornamental fishing has unsustainable harvest practices. In specific, the intensity of cynanide fishing was used as a proxy. Risk for ornamental fish was set based on assessments of cyanide or dynamite fishing by Reefs at Risk Revisited (www.wri.org/publication/reefs-at-risk-revisited) under the assumption that most ornamental fishes are harvested from coral reefs.
