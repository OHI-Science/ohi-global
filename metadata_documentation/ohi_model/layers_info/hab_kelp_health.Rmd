An increasing or stable trend was assigned condition = 1.0, and a decreasing trend was assigned condition = 0.64, based on a 2% global yearly loss of kelp for 50 years. There is likely to be much spatial variation that isn't accounted for by using a global value, but we are limited by the availability of data. Data was from Status and Trends for the World’s Kelp Forests (Wernberg et al. 2019).
