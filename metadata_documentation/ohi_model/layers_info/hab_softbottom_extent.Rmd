Softbottom data is one of the variables in the habitat goal and the inverse is a habitat destruction pressure.

Softbottom extent data is from Halpern et al. [-@halpern2015spatial], which provides 5 different spatial files that represent soft bottom habitat, such as soft sea shelfs, sediment, and benthic mud. These files' native resolution is approximately 934 x 934 meters.
