We used Global Mangrove Watch mangrove cover data to estimate the proportional yearly change in mangrove area using a linear regression model of the most recent 12 years of data (2005, 2006, 2007, 2010, 2015, 2016) (i.e., slope divided by data from the earliest year included in the regression model). This length of data is longer than we usually do, but we feel we get a better estimate using this period of time. The slope was then multiplied by five to get the predicted change in 5 years. The original mangrove data are provided yearly (1996, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2010, 2015, 2016) within polygons (subsequently rasterized to match our regions, and extracted the area).
