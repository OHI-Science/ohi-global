We used Global Mangrove Watch [-@bunting_global_2022] mangrove extent data to estimate the proportional yearly change in mangrove area using a linear regression model of years from 2007 up to the year in question. This length of data is longer than we usually do (typically 5 years), but we feel we get a better estimate using this period of time. Proportional yearly change is determined by first dividing yearly extents by the extent from the earliest year in the model. Year is then regressed on those proportions, and the resulting slope is multiplied by 5 to get the predicted change in five years. The original mangrove extent data are provided yearly (2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020) in the form of polygons - these are subsequently rasterized to match our regions and extract the area.
