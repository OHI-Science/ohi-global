Status of global fish stocks based on B/Bmsy values (the ratio of population biomass compared to the biomass required to deliver maximum sustainable yield).  We preferentially used B/Bmsy estimates from formal stock assessments from the  
RAM Legacy Database [http://ramlegacy.org/](http://ramlegacy.org/) [@ramlegacystockassessmentdatabase2021]. We assigned the stocks to OHI and FAO regions using Free [-@free2017mapping] spatial data describing the range of each stock. When a stock was missing the most recent years of data, carried over the most recent year after 2010 to estimate the missing years. 


When RAM data were unavailable, we use the data-limited catch-MSY model [@martell2016simple] to estimate B/Bmsy values using yearly fish catch reconstruction data. For the catch-MSY model, we defined a stock as a species caught within an FAO major fishing area (www.fao.org/fishery/area/search/en). This definition of a stock eliminated all taxa not identified to species level. This approach assumes that stocks are defined by FAO region, which we know is often not true because multiple stocks of the same species can exist within an FAO region and some stocks cover multiple FAO regions. However, this assumption is necessary without range maps of stocks. The catch data were summed for each species/FAO region/year, and the catch-MSY model was applied to each stock and FAO region to estimate B/Bmsy.
