Sea-ice condition was calculated using sea-ice concentrations from the USA National Snow and Ice Data Center (@cavalieri2021; [https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/quickfacts/seaice.html](https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/quickfacts/seaice.html)) as the current percent cover of sea-ice (average of 3 years of data) divided by the average historical percent cover, defined as the start of the data (1979) until the year 2000 as recommended by the National Snow & Ice Data Center for both sea-ice edge and sea-ice shoreline habitats.
