*Resilience*

*Category: ecological/regulatory*

*Subcategory: nonindigenous species*

Country responses to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Third National Report [-@united_nations_environment_program_convention_2010]. Each
question was weighted equally within each category and responses were averaged to give a score between 0 and 1 for all responding countries. The survey uses a 0 to 3 scale for questions 79 and 81, and a 0 to 2 scale for question 80, which we rescale linearly to 0 to 1.

All countries were given credit within each of the 4 resilience measures for simply being a member of the CBD (0.5), the other 0.5 of the resilience score came from each countryâ€™s response to the specific questions within each resilience measure. In cases where the "European Union" answered yes or was a signatory, all EU25 countries were given that answer if they did not provide one themselves. 

The CBD has 193 members and 153 members responded to the Third National Survey [-@convention_on_biological_diversity_3rd_2005]. We had data for 147
regions, and used geographical means, weighted by country area, for the remaining regions.
