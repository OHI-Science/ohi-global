Trend in seagrass condition was determined using three data sources (Waycott et al. 2009, Short et al. 2010, IUCN Red List of Threatened Species). Short et al. (2010) measured percent percent cover on a per sample, per site, per year basis, and determined species population trends (increasing, decreasing, or stable). The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species also provides species population trends (increasing, decreasing, or stable). Waycott et al. (2009) measured habitat area on a per site, per year basis. We used the population trends from Short et al. 2010 and the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species to assign population trends to the IUCN species distribution maps. Then we used median rate of change per year (%) from Waycott et al. (2009) (Table S2) to assign numerical trend values to each species population trend (-0.0767 for decreasing, 0 for stable, and 0.0845 for increasing). Following this we gapfill missing trends first by species family average, and then by the global seagrass average trend. We calculate the trend per OHI region using an average weighted by species distribution area. Finally, where country data were not available, we gapfill by the georegional average.
