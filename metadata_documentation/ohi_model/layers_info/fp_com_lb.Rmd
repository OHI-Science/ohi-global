*Pressure*

*Category: ecological*

*Subcategory: fishing pressure*

This layer describes the relative pressure of low bycatch commercial fishing practices for each OHI region. The fishery data [@watson2019global] describe catch (tonnes) for each species and gear type at the 0.5 degree raster global scale for both non-industrial and industrial fishing. For each raster cell, we summed catch (which consisted of reported landings as well as illegal, unreported and regulated catch) from the industrial global catch data.    

The catch was then divided by the mean net primary productivity (mg C/m^2^/day) derived from monthly output from the Vertically Generalized Production Model (VGPM,  [http://www.science.oregonstate.edu/ocean.productivity/](http://www.science.oregonstate.edu/ocean.productivity/), 0.5 degree global raster data) [@omalleyocean]. Standardizing catch by primary productivity controls for the fact that similar amounts of catch impart different pressures depending on the productivity in the region. 

The layer was rescaled from 0 to 1 using the 99.99th quantile of the entire data layer across all years of data.  

To summarize at the OHI region scale, the mean value of the raster cells within each OHI region was calculated.
