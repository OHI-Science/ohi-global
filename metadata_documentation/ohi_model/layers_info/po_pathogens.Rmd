The percentage of the population with access to improved sanitation facilities [@who-unicef2021] was used in combination with measurements of coastal population as a proxy for pathogens in coastal waters. Access to improved sanitation facilities is defined as the percentage of the population in a country with at least adequate access to disposal facilities that can effectively prevent human, animal, and insect contact with excreta. These data are a country-wide average (not specific to the coastal region). Percentages (0-100) for each country were rescaled to 0-1 based on a maximum target of 100% of the population with access to improved sanitation, and a minimum value of 0.
Reference point was defined as the 99th quantile across year/region with no buffer and constrained to the first 10 years of data (vs. all available years of data).
