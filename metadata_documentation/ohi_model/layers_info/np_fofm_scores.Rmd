Fish oil and fish meal scores from Global Fisheries Landing Data (Watson 2019) and the RAM Legacy Database [http://ramlegacy.org/](http://ramlegacy.org/). For this layer, nearly identical methods were used as in the fisheries sub-goal calculations. Instead of producing scores for all global fish stocks, we only produced scores for those that contribute to fish oil and fish meal (Froehlich 2018). The tonnes of harvest of these species were multiplied by 0.7 to reflect the proportion of this catch used for oil or feed.
