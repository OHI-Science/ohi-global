Fish oil and fish meal scores from Global Fisheries Landing Data (Watson 2019) and the RAM Legacy Database [http://ramlegacy.org/](http://ramlegacy.org/). For this layer, nearly identical methods were used as in the fisheries sub-goal calculations. Instead of producing scores for all global fish stocks, we only produced scores for those that contribute to fish oil and fish meal, based on a list provided by Avoiding the ecological limits of forage fish for fed aquaculture (Froehlich 2018). The tonnes of harvest of these species were also multiplied by 0.7 to reflect the amount of the fish actually going to oil or feed.
