The [United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO)](https://www.unwto.org/) [-@unwto2023arrivals] includes total international arrivals data. This is provided in the form of thousands of people arriving, which we convert to total number of people arriving. We divide these arrivals by area of coastline for each country (from the [LSP goal](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep_v2023/tree/gh-pages/globalprep/lsp/v2023)) and further by population for each country (primarily from [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL), secondarily from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population), and lastly from Statista ([1](https://www.statista.com/statistics/706807/population-of-saba-in-the-caribbean-netherlands/), [2](https://www.statista.com/statistics/706806/population-of-sint-eustatius-in-the-caribbean-netherlands/), and [3](https://www.statista.com/statistics/706799/population-of-bonaire-in-the-caribbean-netherlands/))), as an indicator of the number of tourists visiting the coast [-@lewis2017largescale; -@worldbank2023population; -@ourworldindata2023population; -@statista2023bonairepopulation; -@statista2023sabapopulation; -@statista2023sinteustatiuspopulation]. 

Missing values in arrivals (for our purposes, "Overnights visitors (tourists)", or the number of non-resident inbound visitor trips including at least one overnight) are gapfilled using "Total arrivals" minus "Same-day visitors (excursionists)" (if available) or, secondarily, by upfilling or downfilling (prioritizing downfilling) years of data based on if the previous or later year has information. Missing values in the primarily-used population data source are gapfilled using the two other data sources, and one data source's years are gapfilled by upfilling. We were not able to further gapfill with other methods at this time.
