The total tonnes of ornamental fish were determined for each region using export data from the FAO Global Commodities database [@un-fao2022]. For each group the sum of the subcategories was calculated.  For ornamental fish we excluded the subcategory ‘Fish for culture including ova, fingerlings, etc.’ because it is not specific to ornamental fish, and the subcategory ‘Ornamental freshwater fish’ because it is not from marine systems. Following this, within each region, the harvest of ornamental fishing was scaled relative to its maximum value across all years. The tonnes of ornamental fishing is divided by the maximum value observed for the commodity in each region. 

If a country was missing tonnes or dollar values (but had one of the values), the missing data were estimated. FAO provides yearly data for the tonnes and dollar value generated for each natural product, however, countries often provide only one of these variables (and the data provided vary across years). To estimate these missing data, we used country-specific linear models to predict tonnes based on the dollar value of ornamental fish (or, vice versa). For the countries that did not have enough data to develop an adequate model, our models included the data for all the countries within a UN geopolitical region. When there wasn’t enough data at the geopolitical region scale, we used all the global data to predict missing values.
