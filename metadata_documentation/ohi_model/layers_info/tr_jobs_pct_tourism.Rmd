The Travel and Tourism Development Index (TTDI) [-@wef_ttdi_2021] includes data describing the percent employment in 2020 in the travel and tourism sectors (such as hotels, airlines, airports, travel agents and leisure & recreation services that deal directly with tourists). These data are originally from the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC). We used the percent employment in "direct" tourism jobs as an indicator of the number of tourists visiting the coast.

For regions not included in the TTDI (primarily territories) and to calculate 2021 percent employment estimates for all regions, we used data from the WTTC Economic Impact Reports [-@wttc_econ_2022]. These data describe percent change in tourism employment between 2019-2020 and 2020-2021. The values were extracted from PDFs downloaded from the [WTTC's Economic Impact page](https://wttc.org/Research/Economic-Impact). 2019-2020 percent change values were applied to 2019 employment values from last year's assessment (directly from the WTTC) to gapfill regions missing 2020 values, and then 2020-2021 percent change values were applied to all 2020 employment values to calculate those for 2021. 

Regions still lacking data were gapfilled using the average values of UN geopolitical regions.
