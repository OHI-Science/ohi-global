This layer describes the relative value of the habitats in each region to coastal protection, and is calculated by multiplying the habitat extent (km^2^) in each region by the habitat protection rank.  

Data is generated in ohi-global/eez/conf/functions.R. 

These data are called internally by ohicore functions (see: conf/config.R to see how these data are specified) to weight the data used to calculate pressure and resilience values. 

**Table 7.4. Coastal protection ranks**

Habitat | Protection rank
------------- | -------------
Coral | 4
Mangrove | 4 
Seaice (shoreline) | 4 
Saltmarsh | 3
Seagrass | 1 
Kelp | 1
