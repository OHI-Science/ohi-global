Sector evenness was measured using Shannonâ€™s Diversity Index, a common measure of ecological and economic diversity that has been applied previously to economic sectors [@attaran_industrial_1986]. The Diversity Index is computed as ${ H }^{ ' }/{ H }_{ max }$ where:

$$
{ H }^{ ' } = \sum _{ i }^{ z }{ { f }_{ i }\ast  } \ln { { (f }_{ i }) }, (Eq. 7.1)
$$

and Z is the total number of sectors, $fi$ is the frequency of the ith sector (the probability that any given job belongs to the sector), and $H_{max} = \ln { Z }$.
