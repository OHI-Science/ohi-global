Seagrass data are used to calculate the coastal protection and carbon storage goals, and the habitat subgoal.

Seagrass extent area (km^2^) was calculated from vector-based data from the [Global Distribution of Seagrasses (version 7.1, UNEP-WCMC, Short FT 2021)](https://data.unep-wcmc.org/datasets/7).
