Contracting parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES, [http://www.cites.org/eng/ disc/parties/alphabet.php](http://www.cites.org/eng/ disc/parties/alphabet.php)) [@cites_member_2015]. The Convention is an international agreement between governments that aims to ensure that any international trade in plants and animals “does not threaten their survival.” All countries party to the Convention are given full credit for membership (territories are given the same score as their administrative countries); those countries that are not contracting parties are given no credit (score = 0).
