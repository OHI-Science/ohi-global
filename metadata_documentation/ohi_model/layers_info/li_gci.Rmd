The World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) provides a country level assessment of competitiveness in achieving sustained economic prosperity (@schwab2017global, [http://gcr.weforum.org](http://gcr.weforum.org)). The GCI is a weighted index based on 12 pillars of economic competitiveness: institutions, infrastructure, macroeconomic environment, health and primary education, higher education and training, goods market efficiency, labor market efficiency, financial market development, technological readiness, market size, business sophistication, and innovation. The GCI can in theory span from 1 to 7, based on this range, we rescaled the scores to range between 0 and 1.  Uninhabited OHI regions are given an NA score.
