Exposure is the ln-transformed intensity of harvest calculated as tonnes of harvest per km^2 of coral and rocky reef of ornamental fishing, relative to the global maximum. We ln transformed the harvest intensity scores because the distribution of values was highly skewed; because we do not know the true threshold of sustainable harvest, nearly all values would be considered highly sustainable without the log transformation. To estimate rocky reef extent area (km^2) we used data from Halpern et al. (2008), which assumes rocky reef habitat exists in all cells within 1 km of shore. Coral extent area (km^2) are from 	UNEP-WCMC et al. (2018).
