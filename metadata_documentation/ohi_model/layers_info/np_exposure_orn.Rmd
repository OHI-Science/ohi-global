Exposure is the ln-transformed intensity of harvest calculated as tonnes of harvest per km2 of coral and rocky reef of ornamental fishing, relative to the global maximum. We ln transformed the harvest intensity scores because the distribution of values was highly skewed; because we do not know the true threshold of sustainable harvest, nearly all values would be considered highly sustainable without the log transformation. To estimate rocky reef extent area (km2) we used data from Halpern et al. (2008), which assumes rocky reef habitat exists in all cells within 1 km of shore. Coral extent area (km2) are derived from the 500m resolution dataset developed for Reefs at Risk Revisited (Burke et al. 2011).
