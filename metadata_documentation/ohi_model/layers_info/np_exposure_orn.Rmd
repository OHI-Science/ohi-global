Exposure is the log transformed intensity of harvest calculated as tonnes of harvest per km^2^ of coral and rocky reef of ornamental fishing, relative to the global maximum. We log transformed the harvest intensity scores because the distribution of values was highly skewed; because we do not know the true threshold of sustainable harvest, nearly all values would be considered highly sustainable without the log transformation. To estimate rocky reef extent area (km^2^) we used data from Halpern et al. [-@halpern2008global], which assumes rocky reef habitat exists in all cells within 1 km of shore. Coral extent area (km^2^) are from @unep-wcmc2018global.
