These data are used to estimate the sustainability of artisanal fishing practices. Artisanal and subsistence fishing scores were calculated from [Sea Around Us](https://www.seaaroundus.org/) catch data [@pauly2020] and the RAM Legacy Database [http://ramlegacy.org/](http://ramlegacy.org/). For this layer, nearly identical methods were used as in the fisheries sub-goal calculations. Instead of producing scores for all global fish stocks, we only produced scores for catch that is denoted as artisanal and subsistence catch in the Sea Around Us catch data.
