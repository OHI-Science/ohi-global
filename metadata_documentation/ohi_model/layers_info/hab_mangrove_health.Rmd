Mangrove condition was defined as the current cover divided by reference cover.  FAO mangrove area data was provided on a country basis for 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2005.  Current condition is based on 2005 cover, and reference condition is based on the 1980 cover. Where country data were not available, we used a georegional average.
