See **`r layer_meta$name[layer_meta$layer == 'hab_mangrove_extent']`** layer for more information.


Mangrove condition was defined as the current cover divided by reference cover. 2020 extents from Global Mangrove Watch [-@bunting_global_2022] were used as current cover. Reference covers for most regions were 1980 estimates retrieved from FAO Forestry Paper 153 [@unitednations2007world]. Regions for which 1980 estimates were not available instead used 1996 estimates from Global Mangrove Watch [-@bunting_global_2022] as reference covers.
