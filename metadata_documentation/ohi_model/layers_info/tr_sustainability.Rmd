The Travel and Tourism Development Index (TTDI) [@wefttdi2021] — successor to the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index — is produced by the World Economic Forum and measures “the set of factors and policies that enable the sustainable and resilient development of the Travel and Tourism (T&T) sector, which in turn contributes to the development of a country.” The index is comprised of five subindexes 17 pillars and 112 individual indicators, distributed among the different pillars. The [2021 report](https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Travel_Tourism_Development_2021.pdf) included scores ranging from 1-6 for 117 countries. 

To calculate this layer we used scores from the Travel and Tourism Sustainability Subindex which encompasses three pillars: Environmental Sustainability, Socioeconomic Resilience and Conditions, and Travel and Tourism Demand Pressure and Impact. 

For countries not assessed, values were estimated using a linear regression model specific to each UN geopolitical region using per-capita GDP as a predictor variable.
