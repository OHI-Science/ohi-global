### Resilience

To calculate resilience for each goal and region, $r$, we assess three resilience categories (Table 5.3, Figure 4.3): ecological integrity, $Y_{E}$, regulatory efforts that address ecological pressures, $Y_R$, and social integrity, $Y_{S}$.  The first two measures address ecological resilience while the third addresses social resilience. When all three aspects are relevant to a goal, resilience is calculated as:

$$
r\quad =\quad \gamma *(\frac { { Y }_{ E }+ {Y}_{R} }{ 2 } )+(1-\gamma )*{ Y }_{ S }, (Eq. 4.10)
$$

We chose $\gamma = 0.5$ so the weight of resilience components that address ecological systems (ecosystem and regulatory) vs. social systems would be equivalent to the proportions used in the model to calculate pressure. 

**Figure 4.3. Resilience components**
Resilience includes both ecological and social resilience categories.  Ecological resilience includes an ecosystem and regulatory category.  The regulatory category includes 5 subcategories that mirror the pressure categories (fishing pressure, habitat destruction, climate change, water pollution, and species/genetic introductions) as well as a goal-specific category.

Each resilience category is composed of 1 or more data layers (Table 5.3) with values scaled from 0-1, reflecting the magnitude of resilience, for each region (an example of one of these data layers describes [tourism regulations that preserve biodiversity](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/blob/draft/eez/layers/g_tourism.csv)).  Each resilience data layer is assigned a weight of 0.5 or 1 (Table 5.3) that is applied equally across all the goals (or, goal elements) influenced by the resilience layer (i.e., resilience matrix, Table 5.4). This information is used to calculate a score for each resilience category. The weight reflects information about governance. 


**Table 5.3. Resilience categories and weights**
The data layers used to calculate resilience for each goal and region for the global assessment (descriptions of data layers and sources are in section 6).  Each data layer is assigned to an ecological or social category.  The ecological category is broken into an ecosystem and regulatory category type.
```{r Resilience categories and weight table, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, error=FALSE}

res_cat <- read.csv(here("eez/conf/resilience_categories.csv")) %>% 
  left_join(full_lyr_names, by = "layer") %>% 
  mutate(subcategory = gsub("_", " ", subcategory)) %>%

#### Ecological resilience

##### Ecosystem integrity

Ecosystem integrity, e.g., food web integrity, is measured as relative condition of assessed species in a given location (scores from the species subgoal were used to estimate ecosystem integrity). For some goals, there is little evidence that our index of ecosystem integrity directly affects the value of the goal (or subgoal).  In these instances, ecological integrity falls out of the resilience model.

For the global assessments, we only have one data layer describing ecosystem integrity, however, if there were multiple layers the overall score for ecosystem integrity would be a weighted mean of all the data layers, $i$, that describe ecosystem integrity ($y_{E,i}$) and influence the goal:

$$
{ Y }_{ E }\quad =\quad \frac { \displaystyle\sum _{ i=1 }^{ N }{ { w }_{ i }{ y_E}_{i} }  }{ \displaystyle\sum _{ i=1 }^{ N }{ { w }_{ i }}}, (Eq. 4.11) 
$$


##### Regulatory resilience
Regulatory resilience ($Y_R$)  describes the institutional measures (e.g., rules, regulations, and laws) designed to address ecological pressures. The regulatory resilience datasets are grouped into five categories that address the 5 pressure categories: fishing pressure, habitat destruction, climate change (including ocean acidification), water pollution, and species introductions (invasive species and genetic escapes). There is also an additional category for goal-specific regulations that apply to a goal or goals, but do not address a larger pressure category.  

Weights were based effectiveness of governance. Governance is a function of 1) institutional structures that address the intended objective, 2) a clear process for implementing the institution is in place, and 3) whether the institution has been effective at meeting stated objectives. At global scales it is very difficult to assess these three elements; we usually only had information on whether institutions exist. However, in some cases we had detailed information on institutions that enabled us to assess whether they would contribute to effective management, and thus, increased ocean health. In those latter cases, we gave more weight to those measures (Table 5.3). 

For each region and goal, we calculated a score for each regulatory category, $y_{R, i}$, as a weighted mean of the resilience data layers, $r_{i}$, that influence the goal (Table 5.4):

$$
y_{R, i}\quad =\quad \frac { \displaystyle\sum _{ i=1 }^{ N }{ { w }_{ i }{ r }_{ i } }  }{ \displaystyle\sum _{ i=1 }^{ N }{w_i} }, (Eq. 4.12) 
$$

where, $w_i$ is the weight in Table 5.3.

To calculate the overall regulatory resilience, $Y_{R}$, we averaged the scores for each regulatory category.  

#### Social integrity resilience

Social integrity is intended to describe those processes internal to a community that affect its resilience. It is a function of a wide range of aspects of social structure. Social Integrity per goal for each region, $Y_{S}$, is therefore:

 $$
 Y_{ S}\quad =\quad \frac { \displaystyle\sum _{ i=1 }^{ N }{ { y }_{ S,i } }  }{ N }, (Eq. 4.13)
 $$
 
where $y_{S,i}$ are the social integrity measures specific to the goal.

Ideally, assessments of social resilience would include state and federal level rules and other relevant institutional mechanisms as well. However, such information is extremely difficult to access for every single country, and so we relied on global datasets that focus on international treaties and assessments. Another key gap is information on social norms and community (and other local-scale) institutions (such as tenure or use rights) that influence resource use and management in many settings. Information on these institutions is also extremely difficult to find at a global scale, although the World Governance Indicator [@kaufmann_worldwide_2010] partly measures their effectiveness through its inclusion of corruption indices.
