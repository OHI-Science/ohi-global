### Goal Description

Artisanal fishing, often also called small-scale fishing, provides a critical source of food, nutrition, poverty alleviation and livelihood opportunities for many people around the world, in particular in developing nations. This goal measure whether people who need to fish on a small, local scale have the opportunity to do so. It has three sub-components: stock, access, and need. A score of 100 means the country or region is meeting the needs of artisanal fishermen or communities by implementing institutional supports, providing access to near-shore water, and maintaining the health of targeted species. 

### Model  

Status model for this goal is a function of need for artisanal fishing opportunities and whether or not
the opportunity is permitted and/or encouraged institutionally and done sustainability. This _need_ was measured by an analogous proxy: per capita gross domestic product (pcGDP) adjusted by the purchasing power parity (PPP), which translates the average annual income (pcGDP) into its local value (PPP). These data correlate with UN data on the percent of a population living below international poverty standard, which directly ties to this need for small-scale fishing. _The opportunity or ability to meet this need_, we used data from the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (UN SDG) 14.b.1, which scores countries on the institutional measures that support or protect access to artisanal and small-scale fishing.

_The sustainability of artisanal fishing practices_ was estimated by subsetting for artisanal and subsistence stock B/Bmsy values which were calculated in our fisheries sub-goal.
 

### Reference points 

The reference point for this goal is when all demand for artisanal fishing is allowed and/or achieved and done in a sustainable manner.
