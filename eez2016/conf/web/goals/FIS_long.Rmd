### Food Provision

One of the most fundamental services the ocean provides people is the provision of seafood. From meeting the basic nutritional needs of over half of the world’s population to being sold in high-end sushi restaurants, seafood is an important benefit of healthy oceans. This goal measures the amount of seafood sustainably harvested within an EEZ or region through any means for use primarily in human consumption and thus includes wild-caught commercial fisheries, mariculture, artisanal-scale and recreational fisheries. Importantly, seafood harvest using unsustainable fishing practices or catch levels is penalized, as well as underexploitation of a sustainable resource as the goal aims to maximize the amount of sustainably produced seafood from wild or cultured stocks. Because we do not track where the fish go after being caught or produced, this goal does not aim to measure food security for the population of a given country, but instead measures the food provided from its waters.

#### Fisheries

This sub-goal model aims to assess the amount of wild-caught seafood that can be sustainably harvested, with sustainability based on multi-species yield, and with penalties assigned for both over- and under-harvesting. As such, one must establish a reference point at which harvest is both maximal and sustainable. Previously this reference point was derived from an estimate of multi-species maximum sustainable yield (mMSY; [@halpern_index_2012; @kleisner_exploring_2013]) based on an approach modified from Srinivasan et al. (2010)[-@srinivasan_food_2010] that used catch data only (i.e., a ‘data-limited’ approach where variables generally required by formal stock assessment methods are unknown, as is the case for most commercially exploited species). Recently, several new data-limited approaches have been developed to assess fisheries that leverage globally available information [@costello_status_2012; @martell_simple_2013; @thorson_new_2013; @rosenberg_a.r._developing_2014]. Building on these methodological advances, we developed a new approach to assessing food provision from wild caught fisheries that is based on estimating population biomass relative to the biomass that can deliver maximum sustainable yield ($B/B_{MSY}$) for each landed stock. The estimates of $B/B_{MSY}$ were obtained by applying a model developed by Martell & Froese (2013)[-@martell_simple_2013], and hereafter referred to as the “catch-MSY” method. The latter was chosen, among other data-limited methods available, based on simulation-testing showing that it most accurately predicted stock status for simulated stocks having a broad range of life history traits and different known sources of uncertainty (i.e., environmental stochasticity, length of available time-series, initial depletion, and temporal autocorrelation; Rosenberg et al., 2014). The catch-MSY approach improves upon the method used in Halpern et al. (2012) [-@halpern_index_2012] in that it: 1) leverages a mechanistic understanding of the connection between harvest dynamics and population dynamics and uses this to infer stock depletion levels (see also Thorson et al., 2013 [-@thorson_new_2013]), 2 ) is an indicator of stock abundance (B) rather than catch, making it more directly informative of stock status, and 3) at least in some cases (i.e., those cases where the catch 10 trajectory is not a monotonic increase), can be applied to developing fisheries (whereas the previous approach assumed a perfect score in those cases).

_Estimating $B/B_{MSY}$ ratios_

Multiple catch only models were evaluated using a known global stock status database, the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database (add citation below), which contains stock assessment information for a portion of global fish stocks. Modeled estimates of stock status were compared with their known status in the RAM database using three catch only models, catch-MSY, SSCOM and COMSIR, along with a variety of ensemble methods (Anderson et al. in press). The catch-MSY model was the most accurate in predicting true stock status and thus was used to estimate stock status ($B/B_{MSY}$) from catch data provided by the Sea Around Us Project (@pauly_sea_2015).

The catch-MSY method is based on the same assumptions used in many stock assessment models [@schaefer_m._aspects_1954], namely that the change in a population’s biomass depends on its biomass in the previous year and two population-specific parameters: the carrying capacity ($_{K}$) and rate of population increase ($_{r}$). The method estimates the status of a given population using landings time-series as proxies for biomass removals from the population, and using empirically derived relationships of relative peak to current catch values to estimate depletion at the end of the time series [@martell_simple_2013]. Then, a sampling procedure is used to estimate the distribution of values of $_{r}$ and $_{K}$ that are compatible with the estimated current depletion levels, and are constrained within the range that maintains viable population abundance and at the same time does not exceed the population’s carrying capacity. In the original formulation of Martell & Froese (2013)[-@martell_simple_2013] the geometric mean $_{r}$ and $_{K}$ were used to derive an estimate of MSY. Rosenberg et al. (2014)[-@rosenberg_a.r._developing_2014] modified this method by producing a biomass time series for each of the viable $_{r-K}$ pairs using the surplus production model. The arithmetic mean biomass time series was selected and the current year stock abundance ($_{B}$) relative to the abundance that achieves $_{MSY}$ ($B_{MSY}$) produced a measure, $B/B_{MSY}$.

Another parameter, final biomass, is estimated by the model and requires setting a prior distribution. The original catch-MSY method [@martell_simple_2013] is derived from stock reduction analysis (**Kimura and Tagart 1982 -> no ref in Halpern2015**), whereby a time series of catch is combined with an estimate of the final biomass relative to an unfished or initial biomass state (i.e., depletion level) in order to estimate historical biomass trends. The model applies a rule to constrain the prior on final biomass based on catch in the final year relative to historical peak catch. However, we found this rule caused the model to frequently estimate a decline in $B/B_{MSY}$ for stocks with declining catch in the final years of the time-series. Explorations suggested that these included cases of managed fisheries where reduced catch was due to declining effort rather than declining population biomass. On the other hand, removing this constraint and assuming a uniform prior caused the model to estimate that all stocks with declining catch in the final years were rebuilding (i.e., biomass was increasing due to a reduction in fishing pressure), which in turn was unrealistic. Previously we had assigned a resilience score to each stock that determined whether a uniform or constrained prior was more appropriate. After comparing the estimates of $B/B_{MSY}$ for stocks in the RAM database with their true $B/B_{MSY}$, the best performer was the catch-MSY model with a constrained prior.

_Spatial allocation of catch to EEZs_

FAO data report commercial fishing landings (here used as a proxy for catch) by fishing country (i.e., for vessels, the flag state) and by major fishing area, but does not provide a finer spatial allocation. In order to assign scores to reporting regions for fisheries within their EEZ boundaries, we previously used the catch allocated as in Watson et al. (2004) [-@watson_mapping_2004]. This spatial allocation method distributes FAO catches globally within a grid of one half-degree cell resolution, using maps of spatial distribution of commercial taxa, and allocating catches to fleets based on fishing access agreements. These half-degree resolution maps were then used to estimate the total catch per taxonomic group for each Sea Around Us Project reporting region, generally corresponding to EEZs, but in some cases to sub-regions of EEZs (www.seaaroundus.org; **Table G**). However, since the catch data and allocation rules have not been updated since 2006, we re-allocated FAO catch data from 2007-2011 into EEZs maintaining the relative proportion of stocks per EEZ per fishing area from 2006, but updating the values for total biomass per taxon per major fishing area and, where possible, updating the taxonomic resolution of the reporting (see data description in ‘5.68: Spatially-allocated catch data’ below)

_Goal model calculations_

The status of wild caught fisheries ($x_{FIS}$) for each reporting region (i) in each year was calculated as the geometric mean of the stock status scores, SS. These scores were derived from $B/B_{MSY}$ for each taxon landed within each FAO major fishing area (A, noted below) and weighted by its relative contribution to overall catch (C), such that:

$$
x_{FIS} = \prod _{ i=1 }^{ n }{ { SS }_{ i }^{ (\frac { { C }_{ i } }{ \sum { { C }_{ i } }  } ) } } (Eq. S2)
$$

where $_{i}$ is an individual taxon and n is the total number of taxa in the reported catch for that country throughout the time-series, and $_{C}$ was calculated as the taxon average for each of our reporting regions in each year across the catch time-series since the first nonnull record. We used the geometric weighted mean to account for the portfolio effect of exploiting a diverse suite of resources, such that small stocks that are doing poorly will have a stronger influence on the overall score than they would using an arithmetic weighted mean, even though their $_{C}$ contributes relatively little to the overall tonnage of harvested seafood within a given region. The behavior of the geometric mean is such that improving a well-performing stock is not rewarded as much as improving one that is doing poorly. We believe this indicator behavior is desirable because the recovery of stocks in poor condition requires more effort and can have more important effects on the system than making a species that is already abundant even more abundant. In this way, the score is not solely driven by absolute tonnes of fish produced and accounts for preserving the health of a diversity of species.

Because many fish populations straddle the boundaries of EEZs, we applied the catch-MSY model to catch aggregated within each major fishing area A. These values of stock status were then assigned to our reporting regions, weighted by their relative mean catch in that reporting region’s catch (note that for a geometric mean weights appear in the exponent). This differs from the previous iteration, where the catch stream from each Sea Around Us Project reporting region (or EEZ) was analyzed separately. Any aggregation method will be biased in some way, but populations with the largest catches are most often straddling stocks, so a bias in assessments due to erroneous aggregation of catch could occur more often with cosmopolitan species that include small, sedentary (i.e., patchily distributed) populations that are less likely to play a dominant role in a country’s fisheries.

Based on the ISSCAAP convention for taxon codes (http://www.fao.org/fishery/collection/asfis/en), 6 levels of taxonomic aggregation ($_{g}$) are defined, from 6 (species) to 1 (order or higher) (see ‘5.68. Spatially-allocated catch data’ for more details). The catch-MSY model was only run when catch was reported at the species level, i.e., taxon group level 6, as the time-series of catch across miscellaneous taxa is unlikely to fit required model assumptions. Overall, we were able to assess a total of 1874 stocks. The estimated species level values of $B/B_{MSY}$ were used to derive a stock status score, $_{SS}$, such that the best score is achieved for stocks at $B/B_{MSY}$ = 1, with a 5% error buffer, and it decreases as the distance of B from $B_{MSY}$ increases, due to under- or over-exploitation. For each species reported, within each major fishing area A, SS was calculated as:

$$
SS_{A,g=6} = \left\{ B/{ B }_{ MSY }\quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad if\quad B/{ B }_{ MSY }\quad <\quad 0.95\\ 1\quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad if\quad 0.95\le B/{ B }_{ MSY }\le 1.05\\ max\left\{ 1-\alpha (B/{ B }_{ MSY }-1.05),\quad \beta  \right\} \quad \quad \quad if\quad B/{ B }_{ MSY }>1.05 \right \quad \quad (Eq.\quad S3)
$$

where, for $B/B_{MSY}$ < 1 (-5% buffer), $_{SS}$ declines with direct proportionality to the decline of B with respect to $B_{MSY}$, while for $B/B_{MSY}$ > 1 (+5% buffer), $_{SS}$ declines at a rate α, where α = 0.5, so that as the distance of B from $B_{MSY}$ increases, $_{SS}$ is penalized by half of that distance. For $B/B_{MSY}$ > 1.05, β is the minimum score a stock can get, and was set at β = 0.25. The α value ensures that the penalty for under-harvested stocks is half of that for over-harvested stocks (α = 1.0 would assign equal penalty). The β value ensures stocks with $B/B_{MSY}$ > 1.4 due to, for example, an exceptionally productive year, are not unduly penalized, and also recognizes that it is much easier to improve the goal score when stocks are under-harvested (i.e., increase fishing pressure) than it is when populations are over-harvested and need to be rebuilt. Both parameters α and β were chosen arbitrarily because there is no established convention for this particular approach. Thus, consistent with previous work [@halpern_index_2012], countries are rewarded for having wild stocks at the biomass that can sustainably deliver the maximum sustainable yield, +/-5% to allow for measurement error, and are penalized for both over- or under-harvesting.

For taxa reported at a higher level than species, we developed a method to account for coarser resolution data. The distribution of the species-based estimates within the same fishing area and year was used to generate missing scores. An increasing penalty was applied for increasingly coarser taxonomic reporting, as this is considered a sign of minimal monitoring and management, so that, for a given taxonomic aggregation $_{g}$ (when $_{g}$<6), a proxy value for $B/B_{MSY}$ was estimated as follows:

$$
B/B_{MSY\quad A,g<6} = \left\{ 0.01*median\{ B/{ B }_{ MSY\quad A,g,\forall g=6 }\} \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad if\quad g=1\\ 0.25*median\{ B/{ B }_{ MSY\quad A,g,\forall g=6 }\} \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad if\quad g=2\\ 0.50*median\{ B/{ B }_{ MSY\quad A,g,\forall g=6 }\} \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad if\quad g=3\\ 0.80*median\{ B/{ B }_{ MSY\quad A,g,\forall g=6 }\} \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad if\quad g=4\\ 0.90*median\{ B/{ B }_{ MSY\quad A,g,\forall g=6 }\} \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad if\quad g=5 \right \quad \quad (Eq.\quad S4)
$$

The resulting value was then used to obtain the stock status score as shown in equation S2. Previously (Halpern et al. 2012), reporting quality was penalized with a taxonomic reporting coefficient, $T_{c}$; we do not use this parameter here as it would be a double-penalty for data reporting quality.

_Model limitations_

Both the current and previous [@halpern_index_2012] methods are based on single-species assessments of stock status and thus cannot predict the effect of multi-species interactions. Previously, the sum of single-species MSY was reduced by 25% to obtain a more precautionary estimate of multi-species MSY that might account for the effect of these interactions. The current approach adopts B=$B_{MSY}$ as a single-species reference point, which by various assessment frameworks is considered very conservative (e.g., Froese et al. 2011 [-froese_generic_2011]), and the fact that the single-species values are aggregated using a geometric mean ensures that some multi-species effects may influence the scores. Nonetheless, a better understanding of the emerging effects of fishing various species at their reference levels would be desirable and will hopefully be possible in the future.

Despite the fact that invertebrates represent 12 of the top 17 species for global caught biomass, and represent the dominant stocks in many EEZs, stock assessment approaches for these taxa are poorly developed. The catch-MSY approach was applied to invertebrates even though the model developers only tested it on fish [@martell_simple_2013]. Part of the challenge in broadly testing this approach on organisms other than fish is the lack of a large enough collection of invertebrate assessments to use for validation testing (e.g., only 17 invertebrate assessments are currently available in the RAM2 Legacy stock assessment database, less than half of which include estimates of $B_{MSY}$; Ricard et al. 2012 [-@ricard_examining_2012]).

Even though the openly accessible RAM Legacy database includes a large collection of $B/B_{MSY}$ estimates from formal stock assessments across many FAO fishing areas, we were unable to include these in our calculations as there were <40 values for 2008 or later. When more updated versions of the database are made public, we will most likely be able to replace data-poor estimates with values from formal assessments.

This approach captures whether stocks have been historically well managed, but it is worth noting that this calculation does not directly measure current food production, contrary to the previous formulation that compared current catch to MSY.

It is also worth noting that, similar to the previous version, current management does not influence the present status, but it does influence the likely future state, through the resilience dimension and potentially through the trend, at least for highly dynamic stocks with quick response to management.
