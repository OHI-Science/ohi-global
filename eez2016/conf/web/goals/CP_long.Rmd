This goal aims to assess the amount of protection provided by marine and coastal habitats to coastal areas that people value, both inhabited (homes and other structures) and uninhabited (parks, special places, etc.). At local and regional scales data may exist on all these variables at a high enough resolution to map and calculate exactly which habitats are providing how much protection to which coastal areas. At global scales, such data do not exist and so we focused on EEZ-scale assessments, even though this scale does not allow one to account for the spatial configuration of habitats relative to coastal areas and human populations. Consequently, we assumed that all coastal areas have value (and equal value) and assessed the total area and condition of key habitats within each EEZ (without regard to their precise location relative to coastal areas). The habitats that provide protection to coastal areas for which we have global data include mangroves, coral reefs, seagrasses, salt marshes, and sea ice.


The Status of this goal ($x_{CP}$) was calculated to be a function of the relative health of the habitats that provide shoreline protection and weighted by their area and protectiveness rank, such that:

$$
x_{cp} = \frac { \sum _{ i=1 }^{ k }{ { (h }_{ k } } \times { w }_{ k }\times { A }_{ k }) }{ \sum _{ i=1 }^{ k }{ { (w }_{ k }\times { A }_{ k }) }  }
$$

Where:

$$
h = \frac { C_{ c } }{ { C }_{ r } }
$$

$_{C}$ is the condition at current ($_{c}$) and reference ($_{r}$) time points, $_{w}$ is the rank weight of the habitat’s protective ability, and $_{A}$ is the area within a region for each k habitat type.

We employed several different methods for calculating condition scores depending on habitat and available data (see Table S8). The maximum rank of only existing habitats (rather than all possible habitats) is used so that countries that never had mangroves, coral reefs, or sea ice do not get penalized for not having them. See Biodiversity goal (**section 6J**) for details on how habitat data were processed. For mangroves, we focused only on forests in the ocean (1km coastal strip) as they are main source of coastal protection.

As with the Carbon Storage goal, reference area for each habitat is treated as a fixed value; in cases where current area might exceed this reference value (e.g., through restoration), we cap the score at the maximum value (1.0). Although this does not give credit for restoration efforts improving things, data tend to be of poor quality making it difficult to determine true increases, and in general habitat restoration beyond reference values is extremely unlikely. Rank weights for the protective ability of each habitat ($w_{k}$) come from previous work [@ncp__2011] that ranks mangroves, corals and sea ice as 4, salt marshes as 3, and seagrasses as 1 (higher values are better).

The Trend for this goal is then the annual change in ranked condition converted to a 5-year time horizon, as per general methods in section 2B. Because of variable data availability and quality for each habitat, slightly different methods were used for each habitat (see **Table S8**).

We identified a subset of possible pressures that affect the condition of the key protective habitats and therefore the potential delivery of this goal, including chemical and nutrient pollution, alien species, subtidal and intertidal habitat destruction, destructive artisanal fishing, and changes in sea surface temperature (_SST_), ocean acidification, and UV radiation (**Table S22** and **section 2C** for details). Resilience was measured as the average of the regulatory measures (_G_) related to pollution mitigation and habitat protection, and the social integrity measures captured by the World Bank’s WGI. See general methodology above (**section 2D**) for details on how the Resilience layers were combined.

|Habitat| Method for Calculating Condition| Method for Calculating Area | Data Used for Calculating Trend |
|----|----|----|----|
|Seagrass | Current % cover or hectares of habitat divided by reference % cover or hectares | Seagrass extent per oceanic region (vector based) | Calculated across data from 1975-2010 |
|Coral| reefs Current % cover divided by reference % cover | Coral reef extent per oceanic region (500 m resolution) | Calculated across data from 1975-2006|
|Mangroves | Current hectares divided by reference hectares, for coastal mangroves only | Mangrove extent per oceanic region (rastor based) | Calculated across data from 1980-2005|
|Salt marsh| Increasing or stable trend assigned condition = 1.0; decreasing trend assigned condition = 0.5 | Salt marsh extent per oceanic region | Categorical trend assessments (increasing = 0.5, stable = 0, or decreasing = -0.5) |
|Sea Ice| Current % cover (monthly shoreline pixels) with concent. >15% divided by reference % cover average from 1979-2000 | Same as condition | Calculated from the fitted slope of % deviation from reference per year for 3-yr average from 2005-2009|
