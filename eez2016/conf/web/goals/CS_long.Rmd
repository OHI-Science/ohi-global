<!-- Hi Casey, please look over this description and edit as needed. I highlighted "Table", "sections" etc to fill in later as they are likely to be changed from the 2012 and 2015 papers. The CS section is a combination of 2012 and 2015 papers I had access to.   -->


The present-day pelagic ocean sink for anthropogenic carbon dioxide, estimated at approximately 2000 TgC yr<sup>-1</sup>, accounts for about a quarter of total anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to the atmosphere and helps mitigate a key driver of global climate change ***41*** . 
The physical-chemical mechanisms driving the ocean sink are well understood but are not directly amenable to human management. Deliberate carbon sequestration strategies via direct injection and biological fertilization have been proposed but are controversial [@buesseler_environment:_2008]. 
Highly productive coastal wetland ecosystems (e.g., mangroves, salt marshes, seagrass beds) have substantially larger areal carbon burial rates than terrestrial forests, and so-called "Blue Carbon" has been suggested as an alternate, more manageable carbon sequestration approach. 
The global carbon removal by these system is not well known, ranging in a recent estimate from 67-215 TgC yr<sup>-1</sup> [@hopkinson_carbon_2012], though the fraction of this flux attributable as an anthropogenic rather than natural sink is poorly characterized. 
The rapid destruction of these coastal habitats may release large amounts of buried carbon back into the ocean-atmosphere system. Donato and colleagues [@donato_mangroves_2011], for example, estimate that mangrove deforestation generates emissions of 20-120 TgC yr<sup>-1</sup>. 
Our focus here, therefore, is on coastal habitats because they are threatened, have large amounts of stored carbon that would rapidly be released with further habitat destruction, have the highest per-area sequestration rates of any habitat on the planet, and are amenable to management, conservation, and restoration efforts. We refer to this goal as Carbon Storage but intend its meaning to include sequestration.

We focused on three coastal habitats known to provide meaningful amounts of carbon storage: mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes [@duarte_marine_2000]. 
For mangroves, we focused all forests, including coastal mangroves that are on land or in river deltas which provide significant additional amounts of carbon storage. 
As with other goals that rely on habitats for Status, we measured the Status of Carbon Storage ($x_{CS}$) as a function of its current ‘condition’ ($C_{c}$) relative to a reference condition ($C_{r}$) , the amount of area each habitat covers ($A_{k}$)  relative to the total area covered by all three habitats ($A_{T}$)  given the available data, and a coefficient, or weight ($w$), to account for the relative contribution of each habitat type ($k$) to total carbon storage [@d._klaffoley_management_2009] (see **Table num. below**). 
See Biodiversity goal (**section 6J**) for details on how habitat data were processed.

Table ???. Weighting factors on relative carbon sequestration rates for habitats used in the carbon storage goal.

|Habitat Carbon storage| weight|
|----------------------|-------|
| Mangrove             |   139 |
| Saltmarsh            |   210 |
| Seagrass             |    83 |


Thus, Status is:

$$
x_{CS} = \sum _{ 1 }^{ k }{ (\frac { { C }_{ c } }{ { C }_{ r } }  } \times \frac { { A }_{ k } }{ { A }_{ T } } \times \frac { w_{ k } }{ { w }_{ T } } ) (Eq. ???)
$$

We employed several different methods for calculating habitat condition scores depending on the habitat of interest and available data (see **Table S7**).

We scaled each habitat’s area to $A_{T}$ for two reasons. First, it avoids penalizing a country that naturally lacks one of the habitats (e.g., Canada is too cold to have mangroves). Second, it ensures that habitats influence the goal score proportionately to their area of extent. 
This rewards the protection of large extents of habitat but does not assign a higher weight to higher habitat diversity. As such, our measure underestimates the actual amount of carbon storage being done by these coastal habitats (because we cannot account for habitats we do not know exist). 
Reference area for each habitat is treated as a fixed value; in cases where current area might exceed this reference value (e.g., through restoration), we cap the score at the maximum value (1.0). Although this does not give credit for restoration efforts improving things, data tend to be of poor quality making it difficult to determine true increases, and in general habitat restoration beyond reference values is extremely unlikely.

The Trend for this goal is the slope of the change in Status, as per general methods in **section 2B**. Because of variable data availability and quality for each habitat, slightly different methods were used for each habitat (see **Table S7**). 
We identified a subset of possible pressures that affect the condition of the key protective habitats and therefore the potential delivery of this goal, including chemical and nutrient pollution, alien species, subtidal and intertidal habitat destruction, destructive artisanal fishing, and changes in sea surface temperature (SST), ocean acidification, and UV radiation (**Table S22 and section 2C** for details). 
Resilience was measured as the average of the regulatory measures (Reg) related to pollution mitigation and habitat protection, and the social integrity measures captured by the World Bank’s WGI. See general methodology above (**section 2D**) for details on how the layers were combined.

Ideally, we would assign different weights to the habitats based on their relative ability to store carbon, but exact values are currently poorly known. This model can incorporate such weights once they are available in a similar way to the methods developed for the Coastal Protection goal (see following section).


**Table S7**. Reference states for each habitat for which it is known and used in the Carbon Storage model.

|Habitat| Method for Calculating Condition | Method for Calculating Area | Data Used for Calculating Trend |
|-------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|
|Seagrass| Current % cover or hectares of habitat divided by reference % cover or hectares | Seagrass extent per oceanic region (vector-based) | Calculated across data from 1975 to 2010|
|Mangrove| Current km<sup>2</sup> divided by reference hectares| Reference hectares | Calculated across data from 1980 to 2005|
|Salt marsh| Increasing or stable trend assigned condition = 1.0; decreasing trend assigned condition = 0.5 | Salt marsh extent per oceanic region |Categorical trend assessments (increasing = 0.5, stable = 0, or decreasing = -0.5)|
