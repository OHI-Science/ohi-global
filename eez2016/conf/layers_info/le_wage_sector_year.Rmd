We used the Occupational Wages around the World (OWW) database produced by Remco H. Oostendorp and Richard B. Freeman in 2005 (http://www.nber.org/oww/). These data were drawn from the International Labour Organization and subjected to a standardization process (for more information, see http://www.nber.org/oww/Technical _document_1983-2003_standardizationv3.pdf). The database provides several different calibrations, and we use the “x3wl calibration”, described by the database creators as a “country-specific and uniform calibration with lexicographic weighting,” and recommended as being the preferred calibration in most cases. Although significant gaps exist in this database, it contains country-specific information on average wages in many industries for more than 150 countries from 1983-2003. Data represent average monthly wages of a male worker. Wage data were divided by the inflation conversion factor for 2010 so that wage data across years would be comparable (http://oregonstate.edu/cla/polisci/sahr/sahr), and then multiplied by the purchasing power parity-adjusted per capita GDP (ppppcgdp, WorldBank).  The adjusted wage data were then multiplied by 12 to get annual wages. We used the industry and occupation classifications reported in the OWW to estimate wages for marine-related sectors.


Sector | Occupation classifications
------- | --------------------------
Commercial fishing | Industry: deep sea & coastal fishing \nOccupations: deep sea fisher; inshore (coastal) maritime fisherman
Ports & harbors | Industry: supporting services to maritime transport; \nOccupation: dock worker
Ship & boat building | Industry: shipbuilding and repairing; \nOccupation: ship plater
Tourism | Industry: restaurants and hotels; \nOccupations: hotel receptionist; cook; waiter; room attendant or chambermaid. \nThese data are not specific to coastal/marine tourism jobs, and thus we assumed that wages in these jobs are equal in coastal and non-coastal areas
Transportation & shipping | Industry: maritime transport; \nOccupations: ship's chief engineer; ship's passenger stewards; able seaman
