The sea level rise pressure layer is derived from satellite altimetry data, which can be viewed at: http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/products/sea-surface-height-products/global/msla-mean-climatology.html. Monthly mean sea level anomalies from 1993 through 2015 track changes in sea level (mm) compared to a reference period from 1993-2012. Raw monthly data are provided on a 0.25x0.25 degree grid. After downloading, the data were subsequently clipped to within 3 nautical miles of the coast, and monthly data layers were aggregated and averaged across pixels to compute mean sea level anomalies. All annual layers were then stacked and the 99.99th quantile of the entire dataset was used as the reference point to rescale the layer from 0 to 1. All negative values were set to zero (i.e., no negative pressure), such that only positive sea level rise values mattered.
