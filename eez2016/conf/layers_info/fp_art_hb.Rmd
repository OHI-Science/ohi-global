Reefs at Risk Revisited (Burke et al. 2007) recorded the presence of destructive artisanal blast and poison (cyanide) fishing in a country based on survey observations and expert opinion. For reclassified the log-scale scoring system for the blast and poison rasters, so 0 = 0, 100 = 1, 1000 = 2.  The mean raster score was then determined for each OHI region.  The poison and blast values for each region were then summed to get the total. 

A notable limitation of using these data as a proxy for high bycatch artisanal fishing is that they only cover coral reef habitats. High bycatch artisanal fishing likely exists in every coastal country on the planet, but we have no way of knowing the type or extent (for every country).
